<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE JOY OF ANTICIPATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Elk Creek Valley was a blue and golden place
that mid-summer morning in the Big Horn Country.
It seemed like a joyous secret tucked away
among the mountains, whose hazy, far-away summits
were as blue as the sky above them. The
lower ranges, too, were blue from purple haze and
gray-green sagebrush, while the bare, brown foot-hills
tumbling about their feet were golden in the
sunlight. Blue lupines and great spikes of mountain
larkspur made of the Valley itself a garden which
sloped gently to the creek, and lost itself in a maze
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
of quaking-asps and cottonwoods. As for the creek
waters, they ceased their tumultuous haste upon
nearing the garden, and were content to move
slowly so that they might catch and hold the sunlight
in their amber depths. Beyond the creek, and
through a gap in the foot-hills, the prairie stretched
for miles&mdash;blue and green with oats and wheat and
alfalfa. Now and then a mountain bluebird was
lost to sight among the larkspur, and always a cloud
of tiny blue butterflies circled above the creek.</p>
<p>Two pair of delighted eyes&mdash;one gray and the
other blue&mdash;gazed upon the loveliness of everything
as their owners watered a team of big bay
horses at the ford. The gray eyes belonged to a
girl of seventeen&mdash;a girl with golden-brown hair
and cheeks glowing red through the tan of her eager,
thoughtful face. She was radiant with happiness.
It beamed from her eyes and lurked about the corners
of her mouth. She seemed too excited to sit
still. Now her gray eyes swept the prairie stretches,
now scanned the mountains, now peered up the creek
beneath the over-hanging trees. She was talking
in short, eager sentences to her companion&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
owner of the blue eyes. He was a tall, clean, robust
lad&mdash;a year older than she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Don,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it wonderful? Just
think! Our dream is really coming true! I used to
say at school that even if it didn&#8217;t come true, we&#8217;d
have the joy of dreaming it anyway. But it&#8217;s coming&mdash;this
very day! And, oh, Don, isn&#8217;t this morning
perfect? When I found in June they were
really coming, I said I&#8217;d never be selfish enough to
expect a <i>perfect</i> day, because it seemed as though
I&#8217;d had enough already! But now it&#8217;s come, I just
know it&#8217;s&#8221;&mdash;her voice softened&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s a real gift
from God. Don&#8217;t you think so, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Virginia,&#8221; said the boy.</p>
<p>Then he gathered up the reins and drove his
horses through the creek, and on toward the Gap
and the open prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don,&#8221; cried the girl, suddenly clutching his arm
with one hand and pointing with the other, &#8220;there&#8217;s
some wild bergamot just opening! I never knew it
to be as early as this! And see! There&#8217;s a sunflower
on the edge of the wheat field! There&#8217;ll be
thousands of them soon! They&#8217;re like Priscilla!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
She has such big, brown eyes, and is always so
merry and sunny. I know you&#8217;ll like her, Don.
And Mary? I think Mary&#8217;s like the larkspur in the
Valley, don&#8217;t you? So independent, and sort of&mdash;of
<i>self-resourceful</i>, as Miss Wallace says, and true.
I wonder what Vivian&#8217;s like? Oh, I know! The
bluebells back there by the creek. They always
must have a shady spot away from the hot sun.
That&#8217;s like Vivian, but she&#8217;s dear just the same,
and some day I really believe she&#8217;ll be able to stand
hard things as well as the rest of us. Tell me, Don,
are you just as excited inside as I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald Keith laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;only, you see, Virginia,
I don&#8217;t get so excited on the outside as you
do. Fellows don&#8217;t, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; returned Virginia thoughtfully.
&#8220;Father says I need you for a balance-wheel. He
says he doesn&#8217;t know what would happen if we both
talked as much and got as excited as I do. You
see, I&#8217;m seventeen now, and I think he wants me to
begin to be a little more&mdash;more level-headed, and
dignified. But I don&#8217;t know how to begin. Things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
just spring up inside of me, and they have to come
out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try,&#8221; said the boy bluntly. &#8220;I like you
best just as you are, Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed&mdash;a happy, little sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do
if you didn&#8217;t, Don. Think of all the good times
we&#8217;d miss!&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed a little stream, hurrying on toward
Elk Creek. Some quaking-asps made a shady spot
where ferns grew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the spot for gentians in August,&#8221; cried
Virginia. &#8220;The girls will love them so! I&#8217;m going
to try to send some to Miss Wallace. She&#8217;ll be in
Chicago, so maybe they&#8217;ll go safely that distance.
She&#8217;s always told me so much about that wonderful
blue color in the old Italian pictures. She says
that no one has been able to make exactly that shade
since. I told her I just knew our mountain gentians
were that blue, and I&#8217;d send her some. My! I
wish she were coming, too! She&#8217;s so lovely! I
hope, when I grow to be her age, I&#8217;ll be at least
just a tiny bit like her. You&#8217;d like her, Don.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like her anyway for being such a peach to
you,&#8221; said Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget it,&#8221; Virginia told him, a little
break in her voice. &#8220;And especially when&mdash;when
Jim went&mdash;Somewhere Else. Oh, Don, she was
so good to me at that time! And she seemed to
understand everything! I&#8217;ll always love her for
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her gray eyes filled with tears. The boy beside
her placed his hand on hers in quick sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t find a friend like
that every day, Virginia. I wish she were coming,
too! I&#8217;d like to thank her myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia swallowed the lump in her throat and
smiled again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish so, too, but she can&#8217;t, so we must make
the best of it. Aunt Nan is next best. She&#8217;ll love
everything! I know she will. She&#8217;s such a good
sport, too! She&#8217;ll learn to ride and shoot, I&#8217;m sure.
I hope she&#8217;ll want to go everywhere with us, and
that we won&#8217;t seem too young for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Malcolm may go along some&mdash;at least
before threshing starts. He said he would.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Isn&#8217;t he about your Aunt Nan&#8217;s age? He&#8217;s most
thirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Virginia. &#8220;I never thought of it before,
but I guess he is. Aunt Nan&#8217;s thirty, I know,
because I remember she told me she&#8217;d always sort
of dreaded being thirty, but now she&#8217;d reached
there she found it the most comfortable age in the
world. I hope Malcolm will go along. He&#8217;s splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221; returned Donald loyally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one&#8217;s been so dear at home about getting
ready,&#8221; Virginia went on. &#8220;William put the finishing
touches on the flower garden yesterday. It
looks lovely, and Aunt Nan&#8217;s marigolds are all in
bloom. William planted some to make her think
of home. And Alec and Joe and Dick insisted on
riding three of the horses so they&#8217;d be ready for
the girls to ride to-morrow. Hannah&#8217;s baked everything
I like best, and Father bought two bran-new
tents, because the girls want to sleep out with
me. Do Jack and Carver ride, do you suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack does a little. Of course, I don&#8217;t know
about Carver Standish. You think he&#8217;ll fit in all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
right, don&#8217;t you, Virginia? Eastern fellows don&#8217;t
sometimes, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure he will,&#8221; Virginia assured him. &#8220;I
wish you could have seen how pleased he was when
Father asked him to come. And his grandfather,
the old Colonel, nearly burst with pride! Of course
Carver&#8217;s different. I think his father and mother
are very&mdash;well, <i>New Englandy!</i> You know what
I mean. But I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll love it out here. It&#8217;s
lovely of you to have him at your house, Don. He
could stay with us as well as not, of course, but
he&#8217;ll be happier over there with you and Jack and
the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Donald carelessly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s always room for one more at the Keith
ranch. Father says there always will be. Are all
the girls Vigilantes, Virginia&mdash;Mary and Priscilla
and Vivian?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia explained. Mary wasn&#8217;t really a member,
and yet she really was, being the advisor of the
society, and general assistant whenever called upon
to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly was a clever scheme,&#8221; said Donald.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
&#8220;No one but you would ever have thought of such
a thing, Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia discredited his praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;Priscilla would have
done it every bit as well, only she&#8217;d never heard of
the Vigilantes. You see, no one in New England
knows about them&mdash;even Miss Wallace who knows
almost everything&mdash;and when I told Priscilla the
things they stood for years ago, and the work they
did against evil-doers out here in the pioneer days,
we both thought it would be just the thing to name
our society after them. You see, Don, we had to
do something! &#8217;Twas necessary with Imogene influencing
Dorothy and Vivian the way she did, and
I&#8217;ve discovered that when a thing just <i>has</i> to be
done, there&#8217;s always some one to do it. Oh, Don,
see the wind blowing over the grain! It looks almost
like the real sea from Priscilla&#8217;s house&mdash;all
blue-green and wavy&mdash;only I love the prairie sea
better. Won&#8217;t they all just love it? It&#8217;s such a big
country! I&#8217;m getting excited again. That queer
feeling inside has come back, and it&#8217;s a whole hour
before we get there, and before the train comes in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose they&#8217;re doing now?&#8221; asked
Donald, excited in his turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; began Virginia&mdash;&#8220;oh, Don, there&#8217;s
another bergamot!&mdash;I suppose they&#8217;re all out on the
observation platform, looking at everything they
can see. Mary isn&#8217;t saying much&mdash;she&#8217;s just looking,
and Vivian is surprised at all the new sights&mdash;I
can just see how round and blue her eyes are!&mdash;and
Aunt Nan is pointing out things, so as to be
sure no one will miss one of them. Somehow I
can&#8217;t exactly picture Jack and Carver, but I <i>know</i>
what Priscilla is doing. I don&#8217;t even have to imagine
or suppose. I know she&#8217;s just wild&mdash;outside and
in! I can just see her jumping from one side of
the platform to the other, and exclaiming at everything.
Her hair is all blown about her face&mdash;she
has such unruly hair anyway&mdash;and her eyes are almost
black, she&#8217;s so excited over being so near. You
see, I know Priscilla. She&#8217;s a lot like me. She just
can&#8217;t keep still when she&#8217;s happy! I know she&#8217;s got
the same queer feeling inside that I have. Oh, drive
faster, Don! I just don&#8217;t believe I <i>can</i> wait to see
them all!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE ARRIVAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Virginia Hunter was right. Priscilla Winthrop,
her roommate at St. Helen&#8217;s, and junior
partner in the formation of the Vigilante Order,
had not been still for ten minutes since five A. M.
At that hour she had risen from bed, dressed hurriedly,
and bribed the sleepy porter to allow her a
seat on the observation platform. It was contrary
to custom and orders at that hour, but he had done
it notwithstanding. Apparently this young lady
would take no refusal.</p>
<p>Priscilla had moved her chair to the extreme rear
of the platform that nothing on either side might
escape her eager eyes. She had watched the sun
rise from behind the first mountain spurs, and gild
their barren summits and sagebrush-covered sides.
They looked so gaunt and lonely standing there,
she thought, like great gods guarding the entrance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
to an enchanted land. Between her and them
stretched the plains&mdash;here white with alkali, there
barren with sparse sagebrush. Not infrequently
the train rumbled across a little creek or irrigation
ditch around which cottonwoods grew and grass
was green. In these fertile spots there were always
rude houses of logs with outlying shacks and corrals.
Priscilla had shuddered at the thought of living
in such places. These must be other pioneers,
she said to herself, whose ancestors Virginia delighted
to honor. Well, they most certainly deserved
it!</p>
<p>She had hardly kept her seat at all. There was
constantly something on one side or the other which
attracted her attention, and she darted right and
left much to the amusement of the brakeman who
sat within the car and watched her. As they hurried
through one of the irrigated spots, she heard a
bird sing&mdash;a clear, jubilant, rollicking song. Could
it be the meadow-lark of which Virginia had always
spoken? At six they had passed through a prairie-dog
town, whose inhabitants had thus far existed
for Priscilla only in books and in Virginia&#8217;s stories.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Her fascinated eyes spied the little animals, as for
one instant they stood upright to survey this rude
and noisy intruder, and then darted into their house
doorways. She had knocked over two camp chairs
in her excited efforts to reach the brakeman, and
assure herself that they were really prairie
dogs.</p>
<p>But the climax had occurred shortly afterward
when while going through a country of sagebrush
stretches and grim, almost naked buttes, she had
seen&mdash;actually seen a <i>cow boy!</i> He was true to
every description Virginia had ever given her&mdash;sombrero,
bandana, chaps and all! She could not
see his face, but she knew he must be fine-looking
like the &#8220;Virginian&#8221; or like Dick at the Hunter
ranch. He was galloping through the sagebrush on
a mottled, ugly-looking broncho, doubtless bent on
some secret errand.</p>
<p>Priscilla was seized with half a dozen impulses as
she watched him. Should she hurry through four
cars and tell the others that they might see him also?
Should she send the porter? How any one could
sleep at such a time as this was far beyond her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
comprehension! But she had remained, rooted at last
to one spot, and watched him until he was lost to
sight. How would it seem, she wondered, to gallop
alone through this country? She hoped the cow
boy had noticed the sun rise over the buttes; she
hoped that even now he was not blind to the great
mountains in the distance, which were reaching
their blue summits toward the sky.</p>
<p>She drew a long breath of the thin, clear mountain
air! So this was Virginia&#8217;s country! It was
a big land! She understood now what Virginia had
meant by talking about the bigness of everything.
The plains, stretching on and on, gray-green with
sagebrush, the gaunt mountain spurs, the far-away
real mountains, blue and snow-furrowed, the great,
clear sky over all! It must be wonderful at night
with countless stars and a moon looking down upon
the loneliness of everything. There was something
about it all that, in some strange way, pulled out
one&#8217;s very soul&mdash;that made one want to be big in
thought, tolerant, kind!</p>
<p>The brakeman, perhaps alarmed at seeing his interesting
passenger actually standing still, had joined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
her at that moment. Priscilla pointed to a speck in
the sagebrush&mdash;the vanishing cow boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A real cow boy!&#8221; she shouted above the rumble
of the wheels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted her companion. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you
never see one before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; cried Priscilla fervently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t no great sight!&#8221; returned the sophisticated
brakeman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not to you,&#8221; Priscilla shouted in his
ear, &#8220;but it would be if you had dreamed of seeing
one for ten months and three-quarters the way I
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted the brakeman again. &#8220;You
must be a tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; cried Priscilla, &#8220;and I&#8217;m glad of it! You
can only see bran-new things once. The second
time you see them they aren&#8217;t new any longer, and
can&#8217;t give you thrills like the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brakeman grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some yucca,&#8221; he shouted, pointing to a
tall, straight plant with white, bell-shaped flowers
growing by the track.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; screamed the interested Priscilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes folks call it Indian soap-weed,&#8221; explained
the brakeman in her ear, &#8220;because if you
break the leaves they&#8217;ll lather in water. And some
folks call it Spanish bayonet. It grows in barren
places out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put that in my Thought Book,&#8221; Priscilla
told him. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s lucky I have a new one with
all these new things to write about. Why are all
the trees out here those tall cottonwoods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t all,&#8221; answered the obliging brakeman,
&#8220;but the cottonwoods don&#8217;t take so much soil. They
grow easy and quick, and make good wind-breaks,
so folks plant &#8217;em when they build a house near a
creek like that one over there. Quaking-asps&mdash;they
grow well, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quaking-asps!&#8221; cried Priscilla. &#8220;Where are
they? Please show me! I&#8217;d give worlds to see one!
My roommate lives out here&mdash;I&#8217;m just on my way
to visit her&mdash;and it&#8217;s her favorite tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to give nothin&#8217;,&#8221; shouted her
companion dryly. &#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of &#8217;em right along
this creek we&#8217;re passing. They&#8217;re them little trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
with light green trunks and trembly leaves. They
grow by creeks and in springy places mostly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Priscilla leaned over the railing and gazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t they happy? They&#8217;re the jolliest
trees I ever saw!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that is a good word for &#8217;em,&#8221; agreed the
brakeman. &#8220;They sure do dance around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t anything grow on those hills but little
trees and sagebrush?&#8221; queried Priscilla. &#8220;It <i>is</i> sagebrush,
isn&#8217;t it? I guessed it was from pictures, and
from what Virginia said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s sagebrush, ma&#8217;am, and nothin&#8217; much
grows on them buttes except that and rattlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; screamed Priscilla. &#8220;That&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;d
hate to see! You don&#8217;t think I will, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like&#8217;s not,&#8221; encouraged the brakeman. &#8220;They
ain&#8217;t so bad. Must come in handy for something,
else we wouldn&#8217;t have &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Carver Standish had opened the door
for Aunt Nan, who announced breakfast for the
party. Priscilla was obdurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Webster,&#8221; she remonstrated, &#8220;please don&#8217;t
make me eat! I simply couldn&#8217;t do it! I&#8217;ve had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
most wonderful morning of my whole life. I&#8217;ve
seen prairie-dogs and yucca and quaking-asps and
a cow boy, and I know I heard a meadow-lark.
This gentleman has taught me all kinds of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brakeman touched his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been very kind, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Aunt Nan,
too used to her own niece&#8217;s methods of making new
friends to be troubled. &#8220;But we&#8217;re going to reach
Virginia and Donald in another hour, and you must
have some breakfast, Priscilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carver will bring me some fruit,&#8221; persisted
Priscilla, &#8220;and you can&#8217;t see a thing from the window.
Oh, please, Miss Webster! I just can&#8217;t eat
when I have this queer feeling inside of me!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Priscilla had been left in peace, much against
the better judgment of the chaperone; and now at
nine o&#8217;clock, the three Vigilantes with Aunt Nan,
Jack Williams and Carver Standish III viewed Virginia&#8217;s
country together and all for the first time.
The picture which Virginia was at that very moment
painting for Donald was very accurate&mdash;even
to detail. Aunt Nan, eager that no one should miss
a thing, kept pointing out this and that feature of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
interest&mdash;the strange, new flowers by the track, the
occasional log houses, the irrigation ditches, so new
to them all. Vivian sat quietly in one corner&mdash;her
eyes big, round, almost frightened. The endless
stretches of country, the lonely barren places, and
the great mountains somehow scared Vivian. It
was the loneliest country she had ever seen, she told
Aunt Nan. Mary Williams said nothing, but her
dark blue eyes roamed delightedly from prairie to
foot-hills, and from the foot-hills to the mountains,
where they lingered longest. In all her dreams she
had never pictured anything so big and wonderful
as this. Jack and Carver stood together by the railing,
and let nothing escape their eager eyes; while
Priscilla, forgetting to eat Carver Standish&#8217;s banana,
hurried from one to another with eager explanations
gained from her morning&#8217;s experience.</p>
<p>In half an hour they would be there. Already the
barren stretches had given place to acres and acres
of grain, across which were comfortable ranch-houses,
set about by cottonwoods. Beyond the
grain-fields rose the foot-hills&mdash;open ranges where
hundreds of cattle were feeding, and far above the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
foot-hills towered the mountains in all their blue-clad
mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the creek bridge!&#8221; cried Priscilla,
springing to her feet a few minutes later. &#8220;Virginia
has written me a dozen times that when we
crossed that red bridge we should begin to get
ready. I suppose I ought to comb my hair. It&#8217;s
a sight! But Virginia&#8217;ll be so happy she&#8217;ll never
notice in all this world!&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia was assuredly too happy to notice disheveled
heads or smoke-stained faces or wrinkled
suits when she saw her own dear Aunt Nan and her
very best friends step excitedly from the train onto
the little station platform. That queer sinking
feeling inside vanished, and only joy was left.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s come true! It&#8217;s come true!&#8221; she kept crying
as she greeted them all. &#8220;Just think, Priscilla, it&#8217;s
really happening this minute! You&#8217;re all in my
country at last&mdash;Donald&#8217;s and mine!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the world looked very beautiful to them all as
they drove homeward. The three boys on the front
seat became acquainted and re-acquainted, while the
Vigilantes and Aunt Nan behind held one another&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
hands and asked question after question of the happy
Virginia. No, she told them, the days weren&#8217;t all
as perfect, but most of them were. Yes, the sunflowers
grew wild all in among the grain. No, there
were no snakes very near. Yes, it was truly sixty-five
miles away to the farthest mountains. No, she
had never been so happy in all her life.</p>
<p>They stopped at the Keith ranch to receive a copyrighted
Western welcome, and to leave Jack and
Carver. Donald would drive the girls home, and
then return. Mr. David, Mother Mary, Malcolm
and little Kenneth&mdash;all the Keith family&mdash;came to
greet them. It seemed to Jack Williams as though
he had never received a welcome so genuine; and to
the hungry and tired Carver Standish III the simple
brown ranch-house, surrounded by cottonwoods and
set about by wide grain-fields, possessed a charm
unsurpassed by the most stately mansions of New
England.</p>
<p>The Vigilantes and Aunt Nan received as genuine
a welcome a half hour later when they drove down
the long avenue of cottonwoods to Virginia&#8217;s home.
It came not only from a tall, bronzed man, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
shared his little daughter&#8217;s joy, but also from a
white-aproned, kind-faced woman in the doorway,
and a quiet, stooped man by Aunt Nan&#8217;s marigolds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s Hannah,&#8221; cried Priscilla, running to
the doorway. &#8220;She looks just as though she knew
all about the German measles!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sure this is William,&#8221; said Mary a
little shyly, as she shook hands with the quiet man
by the garden. &#8220;It just couldn&#8217;t be&mdash;any one else!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE GETTING-ACQUAINTED TRIP</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;If&mdash;if you&#8217;ll excuse me, Virginia, I&#8217;d&mdash;I&#8217;d really
rather stay at home with Hannah and your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Vivian who spoke. She was clad in a new
riding-suit, which had been worn only during a few
trembling and never-to-be-forgotten moments of the
day before, when Donald had led the oldest and
safest horse on the ranch to and fro beneath the
cottonwoods. Old Siwash would never have
thrown Vivian. Far was it from him to treat a
guest of his mistress in that manner. But in spite
of stirrups, saddle-horn, and the reassuring presence
of Donald, Vivian had, in some mysterious
way, slipped from the saddle, and fallen in an ignominious
little heap by the wayside.</p>
<p>It had been more ignominious to have Priscilla
and Mary, who had themselves been riding but an
hour, come cantering&mdash;actually <i>cantering</i>&mdash;up with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
Virginia to see if she were hurt. She almost wished
she had been hurt. If her leg had been broken, or
old Siwash had kicked, or even her face been cut
just a little, she might have been regarded not exactly
as a heroine, perhaps, but as a martyr at least.
However, nothing was broken except her spirit; old
Siwash had stood stock-still; and her face had
shown no sign of anything save fright and dirt.
The whole situation was quite too much to be borne,
and did not need the disdainful glance which the
critical blue eyes of Carver Standish had cast upon
her.</p>
<p>The Vigilantes had been lovely as they led their
horses and walked to the house with her; Aunt Nan,
who had had her first lesson with Malcolm Keith
that morning, was comforting; Mr. Hunter encouraging;
and Donald the finest boy she had ever known
in her life. It had really seemed as though, with
them all to stand by her, she could mount again the
next morning and go on the much-dreamed of getting-acquainted
trip to Lone Mountain. But now
the time to go had come, and her courage had fled.
She had beckoned Virginia from the corral where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
the men were saddling the horses, and drawn her
away to a secluded spot. Virginia did not need
Vivian&#8217;s confession. Her frightened face was quite
enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I just can&#8217;t do it, Virginia!&#8221; she finished.</p>
<p>Virginia considered for a long moment. Then
her clear gray eyes met Vivian&#8217;s frightened blue
ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vivian,&#8221; she said, &#8220;perhaps you&#8217;ll be angry with
me for speaking so plainly to you, but I&#8217;ve just got
to do it. If you don&#8217;t want the Vigilantes to be
dead ashamed of you, here&#8217;s your chance this minute!
I believe way down in my heart that things
come to us so that we can show what&#8217;s really in us&mdash;how&mdash;how
far down we&#8217;ve been putting our roots
into good soil, you know. Now this has come to
you! There isn&#8217;t a thing to be afraid of except just
Fear, which I admit is a monster; but if you let that
control you, you&#8217;ll spoil your whole life. Jim used
to teach me that. Siwash wouldn&#8217;t hurt a baby! I
rode him when I was four years old. We&#8217;re just
going to trail up the mountain as slowly as can be,
and Don will ride with you every minute. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
there are really things to be afraid of, people excuse
a coward; but when there isn&#8217;t a thing in this
world, they don&#8217;t! So if you don&#8217;t come, Vivian,
and show us what you are made of, you&#8217;re a <i>coward
inside</i>, that&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hard, blunt doctrine, built on seventeen
years of wholesome life in a land where cowardice
has found no room; but at that moment it was just
what Vivian Winters needed. From her frightened
heart the fear of Siwash fled only to give place to a
more dreadful fear, the contempt and scorn of the
Vigilantes. Better be thrown by Siwash than despised
by Virginia and Priscilla, Mary and the far-away
Dorothy. She had no time to tell Virginia
that she would go after all, and to ask her to try to
forget her cowardice, for the boys called just then
that all was ready. But Virginia understood, for
as they hurried toward the corral she held Vivian&#8217;s
hand closely in her own, and gave it a final, encouraging
squeeze, as Vivian edged a cautious way toward
Siwash and the faithful Donald.</p>
<p>After all, it was not so hard. Donald allowed the
others to go ahead&mdash;the two pack-horses first with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
tents and provisions, for they were to camp for the
night, then Malcolm, Aunt Nan and the others. He
and Vivian, riding slowly, brought up the rear.
Vivian, determination rising in her soul, was firmly
seated and clutching the saddle-horn. She might be
thrown, but she would never, never fall again! But
old Siwash was faithful to his trust, and Donald
was close at hand. Vivian vowed inwardly that she
would always bless Donald. Under his calm assurance,
her fear gradually went away, and in fifteen
minutes she was willing to let go her hold upon the
saddle-horn, and to try to follow his instructions.
He taught her how to place her feet in the stirrups,
how to clutch with her knees, how to rise in the
saddle for a trot, how to sit back for a canter; until
at length&mdash;wonder of wonders!&mdash;Vivian, her hair
flying in the wind, her eyes filled with triumph,
actually <i>cantered</i> with Donald at her side toward the
others, who to a rider turned in their saddles and
cheered her approach. And pride filled every one&#8217;s
eyes&mdash;even the critical ones of Carver Standish III.</p>
<p>So now that the worst was over, no one enjoyed
the trip more than Vivian. She kept wondering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
what her timid mother would say could she see her
daughter in the suit which hours of pleading had
with difficulty procured, and on a real Western
horse, riding past the grain-fields, up the canyon,
and on into the trail that led up the mountain-side.</p>
<p>Only three of the nine had ever ridden through
a canyon or followed a mountain trail, and those
three experienced the keenest delight in pointing out
every object of interest to the others&mdash;the blue lupines
and pink cranesbill, which made the occasional
open spaces riotous with color, the forget-me-nots
growing in shady places, and the rare orchids, which
they discovered after they had penetrated to the
heart of the mountain forest.</p>
<p>It was beautiful in among the timber. Great
spruces and pines towered above them like masts
to the journeying earth. The sunlight fell in shimmering,
golden patches upon the moss-grown and
leaf-covered ground. In the more open places grew
buck-brush and the service-berry, Oregon grape with
its holly-shaped leaves, blue lupines, Indian paint-brush
and great mountain ferns. It was very still
when they stopped their horses to rest. Only the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
wind in the great trees above them, the chatter of a
squirrel remonstrating against this intrusion into his
solitude, a strange sad bird-note farther up the
mountain, and the occasional fall of a leaf or creak
of a limb as it rubbed shoulders with its neighbor,
broke the silence. Once in a clearing a deer and her
fawn gazed at them with wondering eyes before
leaping through the ferns into the safe shelter of
the timber.</p>
<p>Up&mdash;up&mdash;up they went. The trail wound in and
out around the mountain-side, and their sure-footed
horses followed it, never daunted by fallen trees or
by rocky and precipitous places. More than once
every Vigilante save one held her breath as she was
carried up a dangerous, almost obliterated path to
heights beyond. But Virginia&#8217;s Pedro, who was far-famed
as a trailer, led the way, and his rider called
back reassuring words to those behind.</p>
<p>By noon the air was cold. They were near snow,
Malcolm said. A few minutes more and they had
reached it&mdash;a veritable snow-bank in late July. The
Vigilantes, reënforced by Aunt Nan, challenged the
boys to a snow-ball fight, and they all dismounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
for the fray. Then came dinner of Hannah&#8217;s sandwiches,
and bacon and eggs cooked over a little
friendship fire beyond the snow.</p>
<p>An hour later they reached the mountain-top,
and lo! it was spring again. The ground was covered
with early spring flowers&mdash;shooting-stars and
spring beauties and bearded-tongues. In the sheltered
nooks they found dog-toothed violets, and
more forget-me-nots&mdash;both pink and blue.</p>
<p>It was here that the inexperienced New Englanders
longed to camp. They wanted to wake in the
morning, they said, and look far across the blue
distances, over the tops of the highest trees, to the
mountains beyond, like Moses gazing into the Promised
Land. But they willingly consented to ride
down on the other side to a more sheltered spot and
camp by a tiny mountain lake, when Malcolm, aided
by Donald and Virginia, explained that a snow-storm
was not an unlikely occurrence away up there&mdash;even
in July!</p>
<p>It was strange to sit around the big camp-fire that
night after supper&mdash;all alone in a mountain wilderness;
strange to rehearse school incidents and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
listen to Malcolm&#8217;s stories of hunting for elk and
antelope in that very spot; strangest of all to go to
sleep on pine boughs and blankets which the boys had
spread in their tents. The weird, lonesome cry of
the coyotes startled more than one sleeping Vigilante
that night, and Vivian nestled closer beneath
Aunt Nan&#8217;s protecting arm. It was not until the
next morning when they started for home that they
knew of the bear, who, smelling the ham and bacon,
had wandered into camp, only to be repulsed by
Malcolm and an extra log on the fire.</p>
<p>In that strange, just-before-dawn stillness Virginia
awoke to miss Priscilla from her side. She
moved the tent flap, and looked out. Priscilla stood
by the entrance, her eyes raised to the distant mountains&mdash;great
shadows beneath a star-strewn sky.
She was learning the old, old secrets of those mountains
at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it, Virginia,&#8221; she whispered, as
she crept back a few moments later. &#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted
so to see what it was like at night, and now I know.
It&#8217;s bigger than ever! I don&#8217;t believe that any one
could look at the mountains and the stars and ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
be doubtful about&mdash;God and&mdash;and&mdash;things like that,
do you?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The next day, perfect as the one before, they went
down, down, down the trail, through the canyon,
across the prairie, and home once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hunter named it just right,&#8221; Priscilla said
to Dick, who came to take the horses. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
felt so well-acquainted in my life!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE BEAR CANYON BEAR</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; cried Alden Winthrop. &#8220;I wish I was
out there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221; echoed his brother John.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I <i>were</i>, dear,&#8221; corrected his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, <i>were</i>, then, Mother. There isn&#8217;t much difference
in the way you say it. I wish I was there
anyway!&#8221;</p>
<p>His mother sighed, but Alden&#8217;s thoughts were far
from English grammar. Instead, they were centering
upon the contents of a fat letter from his sister
Priscilla, which his father had just read.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got more respect for Priscilla than I ever
had in all my life,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I never supposed
she&#8217;d have sand enough to go on a bear hunt. Now,
if she&#8217;d just shot the bear herself, it would be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Alden!&#8221; interrupted his mother. &#8220;Imagine
Priscilla doing a thing like that! You don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
suppose, do you, dear,&#8221; she continued, turning to
Mr. Winthrop, who was reading his daughter&#8217;s letter
for a second time while he finished his breakfast,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t suppose Priscilla is really handling a gun
herself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like it to me,&#8221; said Priscilla&#8217;s father as
he turned the pages. &#8220;She says, &#8216;I can knock a bottle
all to pieces at thirty yards. Don&#8217;t you call that
pretty good?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know the size of the bottle before replying,&#8221;
commented John.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said Mrs. Winthrop anxiously. &#8220;I&#8217;m
willing she should ride horseback and climb mountains
and camp in a perfect wilderness if that&#8217;s what
Western people term pleasure, but I do wish she
wouldn&#8217;t shoot a gun! I&#8217;m afraid I shan&#8217;t have a
minute&#8217;s real peace till she gets home. Of course I
know she&#8217;s in the best of hands, but accidents are
so common. Just yesterday I was reading
where&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mother!&#8221; remonstrated the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry for a moment, Mother,&#8221; reassured
Mr. Winthrop. &#8220;She&#8217;ll come home safe and sound.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
I&#8217;ll trust those good people out there to look after
her.&#8221; He turned the pages again. &#8220;She&#8217;s certainly
having the time of her life! Makes me wish I were
young again myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That skin will look splendid in the library,&#8221; said
Alden. &#8220;Read again what she says about sending
it, Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it all, Dad!&#8221; suggested John. &#8220;There&#8217;s
plenty of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Priscilla&#8217;s father willingly complied. He evidently
shared his sons&#8217; pride in his daughter&#8217;s
achievement.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;July 26, 19&mdash;.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Folks at Home</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am covered with dust and dirt and just dead
tired, but I can&#8217;t wash or dress, or even rest until
I tell you the most thrilling experience of my
whole life! I, Priscilla Winthrop of Boston,
Massachusetts, have helped to trap and kill a
bear! I know shivers are running down your
back as you read this. Imagine then what it must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
have been to live through the <i>real thing!</i> To ride
up the trail all eagerness and excitement; to visit
the empty traps and turn away disappointed; to
see your horse as you neared the third suddenly
prick up his ears and rear&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; cried Mrs. Winthrop. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure,
John, those horses out there aren&#8217;t well-broken!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Winthrop nodded reassuringly, and continued:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To hear Dick call back that there must surely
be a bear; and, at last, to come upon the infuriated
monster, dragging his trap about, gnashing
his teeth, and trying to reach you!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; moaned poor Mrs. Winthrop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; cried the boys.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I trust you are now in the atmosphere to appreciate
my story.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wrote you this morning about the lovely
getting-acquainted trip to Lone Mountain. Well,
I had just come back from walking down to the
main road and giving my letter to the carrier,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
who drives in a funny little canvas house on
wheels, when Dick and William rode up to the
door and asked if we girls didn&#8217;t want to ride up
into the mountains back of Bear Canyon and
visit the bear-traps. Mr. Hunter and the three
boys had gone to Willow Creek, but it&#8217;s a fifty
mile ride over there and back, and he thought it
was too much for Mary and Vivian and me&mdash;much
as we wanted to go.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Fifty miles on horseback!&#8221; murmured Mrs.
Winthrop. &#8220;I should hope so!&#8221;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Virginia had insisted on staying with us, and
Aunt Nan (we all call her that now) had gone to
Mystic Lake with Donald&#8217;s brother, so we four
girls were all alone. Virginia said &#8220;Yes&#8221; on the
spot, and Mary and I were wild at the prospect.
Vivian&#8217;s eyes got big when Dick said &#8220;bear-traps,&#8221;
but she wouldn&#8217;t let us know she was
afraid. Really, you&#8217;d be surprised at what a good
sport Vivian&#8217;s getting to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We said we&#8217;d be ready in a minute and hurried
into our riding clothes while Dick and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
William went to saddle our horses. All the time we
kept fairly <i>pelting</i> Virginia with questions.
<i>Where were the traps? What did they look like?
Did she really think we&#8217;d get a bear?</i> She
wouldn&#8217;t tell us much of anything, except that
bears were not uncommon at all, and that the men
liked to get them, because they were a nuisance to
the cattle. I think we were all seized with different
feelings as we got ready. Vivian&#8217;s came out
and sat upon her face. You just knew she was
hoping every bear in the Rockies had been safe at
home for a week; Mary kept saying the trip up
the trail would be so beautiful, but something
told you she was secretly hoping for a greater
adventure; and I&mdash;well, I couldn&#8217;t decide between
the triumph of bringing a real bear home, and the
awfulness of seeing one caught and killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In half an hour we were off. Hannah had
given us each some sandwiches in a bundle, which
we rolled in our slickers and tied on our saddles.
Dick carried the big gun in a holster, and William
a coil of rope. Instead of turning off on the Lone
Mountain trail we went farther up the canyon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
past the little school-house where Virginia used
to go, and on toward where the canyon walls were
great cliffs instead of foot-hills. It certainly was
the <i>beariest-looking</i> place I have ever seen. You
could just imagine hundreds of them taking sun-baths
on the rocks, surrounded by their devoted
families.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;By and by we turned into a rocky, precipitous
trail, and went higher and higher. It was
much steeper than on the getting-acquainted trip.
Sometimes it just seemed as though the horses
couldn&#8217;t make it, but they did. My horse is a
perfect wonder! He never hesitates at anything.
His name is Cyclone!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I trust it has nothing to do with his disposition,&#8221;
interrupted Mrs. Winthrop.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;At noon we were in a perfect wilderness of
huge trees, great jagged rocks, and thickets almost
as bad as the one Theseus went through to
reach Ariadne. William insisted on building a
tiny fire to cook bacon, so we rustled some dry
sticks and made a little one on a flat rock. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
never in all my life tasted anything so good as
that bacon and Hannah&#8217;s sandwiches and some
ice-cold water from a little creek that was tearing
down the mountain-side.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dick said as we rested for a moment that it
would take us fifteen minutes to reach the first
trap from that spot. It was the most likely place
of the three to find a bear, he added, and at that
Mary, Vivian, and I tried our best to look as unconcerned
as though catching a bear were the
most usual thing in all the world. But when we
had reached the place, after a hard ride through
a narrow trail bordered by all kinds of prickly
things, we found no bear in the queer little log-house
that held the trap. Neither was there one
in the trap a mile distant.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;When we turned away from the second,
bearless and tired, every one of us, except perhaps
Vivian, felt a sense of defeat. My fears of
seeing one caught had vanished. I had borne sunburn
and scratches and lameness and I wanted a
bear. So did Mary. She was not content with
just scenery. Virginia had caught bears before,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
but she wanted one because we did, and William
wanted one because Virginia did. William never
seems to want much for himself some way, but
he loves Virginia, and I think Virginia loves him
next best to Jim. As for Dick&mdash;there was no
mistaking Dick&#8217;s feeling. He felt as though he
had not done his duty by us since there had been
no bear in the two most likely traps.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The question before the assembly now was&mdash;Should
we or should we not visit the third
trap? It might be dark, William said, before we
got out of the canyon, and there wasn&#8217;t one
chance in a hundred of a bear anyway. Virginia&mdash;really,
she is the biggest peach I ever knew!&mdash;proposed
that she ride home with Vivian, and the
others of us go on with Dick and William, but
Vivian would not listen to her. There having
been no bears in the first two traps was proof
enough for Vivian that there would be none in
the last, and her bravery returned. Mary wanted
to go on, and I wouldn&#8217;t have gone home for a
thousand dollars or a trip abroad! As for Dick,
he was already half-way up the trail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This trail was far steeper than either of the
others. It led almost straight up the mountain-side
beneath over-hanging trees, under fallen timber,
and through every kind of bramble imaginable.
But there was something exhilarating about
even the brambles&mdash;something that made you glad
to hear the saddle crunch and whine and creak,
and to feel yourself being carried higher
and higher. It wasn&#8217;t all the hope of a bear
either!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;At last we came to a little creek, which was
hurling itself down over the rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Moose Creek!&#8221; Dick called back. &#8220;The
trap&#8217;s one-half a mile farther on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;On we went, growing more and more excited
every moment. Something strange seemed to be
in the air. I don&#8217;t know what it was, but the
horses must have felt it, too, for just as we had
cleared an especially thick thicket, my Cyclone
began to prick up his ears and to sniff the air,
and Dick&#8217;s horse reared. Then, in a moment, the
others began to be restive. Even old Siwash, who
is lame and halt and maimed and blind like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
parable people at the feast, actually jumped, much
to Vivian&#8217;s horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I just wish you could have felt the shivers
and thrills and quivers that ran down our backs
when Dick halted the procession and cried,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;There&#8217;s a bear around all right! The
horses smell him! We&#8217;ll turn back and tie, and
then go on foot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Five minutes more and we were stumbling
up the trail&mdash;Dick and William ahead, Virginia
and I next, and Mary and Vivian in the rear. I
don&#8217;t know where my heart was, but I know it
was unfastened, for I distinctly felt it in a dozen
different places! Vivian had actually forgotten
to be frightened, and Mary kept saying over and
over again, &#8220;Just think of it! Just think of it!
A bear! Just think of it!&#8221; As for Virginia, she
strode along with her head high, just as she always
does, and looked as though she were able to
cope with any grizzly on earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We gained the clearing almost as soon as
Dick and William, and&mdash;now, listen, all of you!&mdash;there
was our bear!!! I&#8217;ll never forget that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
moment! I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll ever in my life experience
so many different feelings&mdash;triumph and pity
and fear and admiration, all struggling together.
The poor thing lay in the hot sun by the creek,
rods from the little log house which had concealed
the trap, and one of his forelegs was securely
held in that cruel, iron grip. A long, strong chain
attached to some logs held the trap secure, though
bark was torn in layers and strips from the trees
near by, whose trunks the poor, mad, suffering
animal had climbed&mdash;trap, chain, and all. But
now&mdash;nearly worn out&mdash;he lay in the creek, sick
at heart and ready to die.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;As Dick drew the big gun from the holster,
and went nearer, the bear rose to his feet and
growled&mdash;a fierce, awful growl that sent Vivian
trembling to the thicket. All I could think of just
then was Roland keeping at bay the Saracens at
Roncesvalles, or Leonidas withstanding the Persians
at Thermopylæ. There was something
grand in the way that big bear faced Dick. I
shall always admire him for it as long as I live.
I rather believe he was glad to die as Leonidas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
and Roland were&mdash;secure in the thought that his
spirit could never be overcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;William turned his back as Dick raised the
big gun, and made ready to shoot. Then he said
something about seeing to the horses, and hurried
down the trail. Mary joined Vivian in the thicket,
and so did I. I couldn&#8217;t help it. We turned our
backs, too, and stopped our ears with our fingers.
Virginia was the only one who stayed. She stood
by Dick as he aimed and shot. Afterward she
told me she would have felt mean to desert a hero
whose spirit was just about to be taken away from
him. She wanted to pay her last respects. But I
know it wasn&#8217;t easy, for when we all came tremblingly
back a few minutes after Dick had shot,
her eyes were brimful of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then William, too, returned, leading Siwash,
and together he and Dick hoisted the big bear
across Siwash&#8217;s saddle, binding him securely with
the rope. After the horses had become satisfied
that there was no occasion for alarm, William led
Siwash at the head of a triumphal procession, and
the rest of us followed, Vivian on William&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Ginger. Down the trail we went, unconscious of
scratches and aches and sunburn, now that our
aim had been accomplished, and our goal realized.
The awful feeling of pity which we had felt by the
creek went away somewhere, and we were but
victors holding a triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Virginia and I wondered as we rode along
together why it is that you can feel so full of pity
one moment at the thought of killing something,
and yet so full of triumph the next after you&#8217;ve
conquered and killed it. We&#8217;ve decided that the
triumphant feeling is something bequeathed to us
by the cave-men like those in <i>The Story of Ab</i>
you know&mdash;an instinct that makes you want to
prove yourself master; and that the pity is a sign
we&#8217;re all growing better instead of worse. Don&#8217;t
you think that&#8217;s a fairly good explanation? Of
course it is needless to say that Virginia thought
it out!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hannah&#8217;s calling me to supper, and I must
hurry. Mr. Hunter and the boys had just reached
home from Willow Creek as we rode down the
lane. I wish you could have seen Jack and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Carver when they saw the bear. They were wild, and
hailed us as though we were Augustus entering
Rome! Best of all, Mr. Hunter says he is going
to send the skin to you, Dad&mdash;it&#8217;s all black and
curly&mdash;for the library floor. Isn&#8217;t it splendid of
him?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I simply must run and wash, and rustle a
clean middy somewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rustle?&#8221; soliloquized Mrs. Winthrop, as Priscilla&#8217;s
father folded the letter. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
that word before in such a connection, and she&#8217;s
used it twice!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; announced Alden Winthrop decidedly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had much use for Thought Books, but
I believe I could write down a thought or two myself
if I&#8217;d trapped a Rocky Mountain bear!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>JEAN MACDONALD&mdash;HOMESTEADER</h3>
</div>

<p>South of Elk Creek Valley the foot-hills were
less ambitious than those east and north. It was
easy to climb their sloping, well-trailed sides on
horseback or even afoot, and the view across the
wide mesa, blue with sagebrush to the distant mountains
blue with August haze, was quite reward
enough.</p>
<p>Here was real Western country, almost unhampered
by civilization, almost unbroken by that certain
sign of progress, the barbed-wire fence. This
was in miniature what the pioneers must have gazed
upon with weary, dream-filled eyes. Virginia and
Donald, who often climbed the hills together for a
wild gallop through the unfenced sagebrush, liked
always to imagine how those sturdy folk of half a
century ago urged their tired oxen up other slopes
than these; how they halted on the brow of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
foot-hills to rest the patient animals and to fan their hot,
dusty faces with their broad-brimmed hats; and
how their eager eyes, sweeping over miles of ragged
prairie land to the mountains, awful with mystery,
saw this great country cleared of sagebrush, intersected
with ditches, reclad with homes.</p>
<p>Such had been the history of most of the land
above and beyond Elk Creek Valley, and Donald and
Virginia were loath to see this one unbroken mesa
go. They wanted it as a hunting-ground for prairie
chickens and pheasant in the fall, and as a wide,
free, unhindered race-course for Pedro and MacDuff.
Pedro and MacDuff wanted it, too. They
liked to gallop, neck and neck, joyous in the sense of
freedom, and in the knowledge that they were giving
happiness to their respective riders. For years
Donald and Virginia had loved the mesa. They
loved it in the spring when the bare patches among
the sagebrush grew green and gave birth to hardy
spring flowers&mdash;buttercups and shooting-stars and
spring beauties; they loved it in the long blue days of
August and in the shorter golden ones of October;
and sometimes they thought they loved it best of all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
in winter when it lay, silent and very, very wise,
beneath the snow.</p>
<p>But it was to be just theirs no longer. The slow,
steady tide of oncoming progress had refused to let
it alone. In the spring while Virginia was still at
St. Helen&#8217;s, Donald, home for the Easter recess, had
written her of two homesteaders&#8217; cabins on the mesa
toward the southeast, of fences being built, and of
sagebrush rooted up and burned.</p>
<p>It was even less theirs on this August morning,
for the cabin of another homesteader had risen as
though by magic in the southwest corner; ten acres
of freshly-plowed land were being warmed by the
sun and made ready for September wheat; and rods
of stout barbed-wire tacked to strong, well-made
fence-poles were guarding the future wheat against
all intruders. The cabin, superior in plan and workmanship
to that of the average homesteader, faced
the west. It was built of new spruce logs, with well-filled
chinks, and boasted two large windows and a
porch, in addition to its necessary door. Moreover,
an outside stone chimney betokened a fire-place&mdash;an
untold luxury to a homesteader. A second wire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
fence, set at some three rods from the cabin, inclosed
it on all sides, and protected a small vegetable
garden and a few fruit trees, which the owner had
already planted.</p>
<p>It was a good quarter section upon which this
ambitious homesteader had filed. On the south the
mesa mounted into the higher hills, and this claim
included timber; the land already plowed showed the
soil to be black and fertile; and a creek, tumbling
from the mountains and hurrying by just back of
the cabin, promised plenty of water, even in a thirsty
season. With a substantial new cabin, three cows
and a horse, some hens and two collie dogs, a crop
nearly in, fruit trees thriving and a garden growing
like wild-fire&mdash;what more could one desire? Then
add to riches already possessed, the surety of a barn
and corral in September, and the probability of
twelve pure-bred Shropshire sheep, and what homesteader
would not sing for joy?</p>
<p>That was precisely what Jean MacDonald was
doing this sunny August morning; for it was a girl&mdash;a
strong, robust girl of twenty-one&mdash;who had
taken up the southwestern claim on Virginia&#8217;s and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Donald&#8217;s mesa. She was bustling about her little
cabin, setting things to rights, and singing for joy.
Her voice, clear, strong, and sweet, rang out in one
good old Scotch song after another&mdash;&#8220;Robin Adair,&#8221;
&#8220;Loch Lomond,&#8221; and &#8220;Up with the Bonnets of
Bonnie Dundee.&#8221; Sometimes she paused in her
sweeping and dusting and hurried to the porch to
look away across the mesa toward the north, and to
speak to Robert Bruce, her horse, who, saddled and
bridled, awaited her coming outside the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, Bobby,&#8221; she called, &#8220;not yet! There&#8217;s
no sign of them at all, so be patient!&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Bruce was quite willing to be patient.
There was nourishment in plenty between the sagebrush
clumps, and he wandered at will, his dragging
reins giving sure proof that he would not stray too
far.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his mistress continued her singing and
her work. She proudly dusted her new furniture
in the room which served as chamber and parlor, rearranged
her few books in their wall bookcase, swept
up the ashes of her last evening&#8217;s fire, and brought
wood to lay another. Then she turned her attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
to the room which was kitchen and dining-room in
one. From a neat chest of drawers she drew her
best and only white table-cloth and spread it on the
table. The table was a little rickety in one leg, but
several folds of newspaper acted as a splendid prop,
and quite removed the difficulty. Her supply of
china and silver was scarce, but it would do with
washing between courses. Four chairs were all
she had, but they were quite enough as her guests
numbered four. An empty soap-box concealed beneath
the table-cloth, and drawn out only when
necessary, would do for her.</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes everything was in readiness,
even to five early nasturtiums in a tumbler on the
dining-table. They had made a special effort to
open that morning, and the homesteader was grateful.
She paused on her way to the creek-refrigerator
to look in the sitting-room mirror. These
guests were her very first, and she wanted to appear
at her best. Yes, her khaki blouse and skirt were
clean and her hair fairly tidy. Her new red tie, she
told herself, was quite decidedly jaunty. She blessed
that tie, for had it not been for Donald Keith&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
kindness in bringing the package to her from the
town post-office four days ago, she would neither
have known about the girls, nor have had the opportunity
of inviting them to come to see her. Of
course, they were from the East&mdash;all except Virginia
Hunter, of whom she had heard so much, and
she was a Wyoming homesteader; but, she told herself,
that need make no difference. In fact, it made
everything much more interesting, for she could
learn many things from them, and perhaps&mdash;perhaps,
they might learn a little bit from her.</p>
<p>Still singing, she hurried to the end of the porch,
and looked toward the north. Four specks were
distinctly visible on the edge of the mesa. Even as
she looked they became larger. They were horses
coming toward her cabin, and they bore her guests.
She whistled loudly to Robert Bruce, who obediently
ceased his browsing and came toward her. A
quick run to the creek-refrigerator to see that her
butter and cream were safe in the clear, cold water,
and then back to Robert; a leap into the saddle and
she was off to meet her guests.</p>
<p>Introductions are stilted, unlovely things between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
horseback riders on a sagebrush-covered mesa under
a blue August sky. There were none this morning.
Jean MacDonald reined in the restive Robert Bruce
as she drew near her guests, and unceremoniously
greeted them all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know every one of you,&#8221; she said brightly, her
dark blue eyes searching their faces&mdash;&#8220;Mary Williams
and Priscilla Winthrop and Vivian Winters&mdash;all
of you. And I&#8217;ve known you even longer, Virginia.
Donald Keith told me all about you a month
ago when they helped break my land. I&#8217;m so glad
you&#8217;re coming to spend the day with me. You&#8217;re
the very first guests I&#8217;ve ever had on my homestead!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were glad, too, they told her, liking her at
once, and feeling perfectly at ease. She rode beside
Virginia, talking of Donald, the other Keiths who
had been so good to her, and her neighbors in the
southeast corner of the mesa. Virginia, too, talked
freely, asking questions, telling of their recent bear
hunt, joining in Jean&#8217;s admiration of the Keiths.
To the three New Englanders, who rode a little behind
them, this new comradeship, though a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
startling to their inherent conservatism, was interesting
in the extreme. It seemed to be born of a
land too big for ceremonies, too frank and open for
formalities; and soon they found themselves urging
their horses up to Pedro and Robert Bruce, so that
they too might enter the widening circle of fellowship.</p>
<p>All four Vigilantes found themselves studying
the face of this girl who so often turned toward one
and another with a question or a reply. It was a
face too tanned and too large-featured to be beautiful
or even pretty; but the lines about the nose and
mouth were firm and strong, the eyes were wide-open
and fearless, and the head was set most independently
upon a pair of broad, straight shoulders.
There was something about the girl like the mesa&mdash;fearless,
big, wholesome. It showed itself in the
way she managed her horse, in her hearty manner of
laughing with her head thrown back, and in the
calm, sure, straightforward expression of her dark
blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d make the finest kind of a friend, I&#8217;m sure
of that,&#8221; said Mary to herself, and then to Priscilla
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
and Vivian, as they dropped behind for a moment
just before reaching the little cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Priscilla, &#8220;she surely would. I
wonder what there is about her that makes a person
feel small. I&#8217;ve been feeling positively microscopic
ever since she rode up to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you have,&#8221; sighed Vivian, thankful that
another shared her sensation. &#8220;So have I. I feel
about as big as a field-mouse, and I think I know
why. You just know a girl like her would never
fall off a horse, or run away from a gun, or&mdash;do
anything babyish like that. And just imagine daring
to live all alone in a little cabin like this! I&#8217;d
die! I know I should!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the small feeling was forgotten in the good
time which followed. Robert Bruce, unspeakably
glad of company, escorted his four guests to choice
bits of grass in among the sagebrush; the two collies
barked in welcome; and the girls, loaded with saddles
and bridles, went in through the gate toward the
cabin. Jean MacDonald, proud and happy, led the
way into the house and the interested Vigilantes followed.
They had never supposed a log house could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
be so attractive within; but the neat dark furniture,
the couch with its brown cover, the stone fire-place,
and the books and pictures made the little cabin one
of the most homelike places they had ever seen. A
mountain sheep looked down upon them from above
the fire-place. Jean had shot him the winter before
in Montana, she told them. In the corner by the
cot stood her guns&mdash;one large, double-barreled Winchester,
a shot-gun, and a small rifle. Above them
on the logs rested her fishing-rods.</p>
<p>It was all so new and interesting to three pair
of fascinated eyes. They asked question after question
and explored every nook and corner of the
cabin and its surroundings&mdash;the kitchen with its
shining stove, singing tea-kettle, and white-covered
table, the pantry, the root-cellar and chicken-house,
and last of all the creek-refrigerator.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right in the daytime,&#8221; announced Vivian,
as they sat on the porch before beginning to get dinner,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how you stand it all alone
at night.&#8221; She paused. &#8220;I&#8217;d die!&#8221; she finished
simply.</p>
<p>Jean MacDonald did not laugh, though she felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
like it at first, for she saw that Vivian was very
much in earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know how you feel, Vivian,&#8221; she said
kindly. &#8220;I know you would be very lonely, because,
you see, you&#8217;ve always lived in a city or at school
where there have been folks all about you. But,
you see, it&#8217;s different with me. I was born on a
homestead in Montana, and I&#8217;m used to endless
tracts of land without neighbors. I guess I&#8217;ve made
better friends with the mountains than you&#8217;ve been
able to yet, and with the silence which I know some
people fear. You see, I&#8217;ve never been afraid in all
my life, so I don&#8217;t mind the loneliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian was staring at her, incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never&mdash;been&mdash;afraid&mdash;of&mdash;anything?&#8221; she repeated questioningly.
&#8220;Honestly, haven&#8217;t you&mdash;all your life?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean MacDonald considered for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;honestly, I don&#8217;t believe I ever
have. I was brought up never to fear the dark or
the silence or being alone or&mdash;anything like that.
Those are the most awful things, I guess, to persons
who are afraid. And as for wild animals or people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
who would do harm (and there aren&#8217;t many of those
in the world) why, you see&#8221;&mdash;she raised her head
and her eyes flashed&mdash;&#8220;you see, I can take care of
myself! I&#8217;m thankful,&#8221; she added, &#8220;that I&#8217;m not
afraid of things. I think fear must be a terrible
thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian&#8217;s blue eyes filled with sudden tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most dreadful monster
in the whole wide world!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean MacDonald placed a firm, brown hand on
Vivian&#8217;s shoulder as they all went in together to prepare
dinner, and Vivian felt comradeship and understanding
in that friendly hand. Perhaps, some day,
she said to herself, she would be brave also; even
before she went East, she might become a more worthy
Vigilante. At all events she would begin once
more. Perhaps, after all, she concluded, as she ran
to the creek-refrigerator after the butter and cream&mdash;perhaps
after all, life was just a series of beginnings&mdash;again&mdash;each
one a wee bit farther on!</p>
<p>Dinner was the jolliest meal imaginable. They
ate and laughed&mdash;laughed and ate. Everything was
delicious&mdash;the trout caught in the creek and fried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
a rich brown, the baked potatoes, the fresh biscuits,
the lettuce and radishes from the garden, and the
custard pudding. Jean MacDonald with all her
other accomplishments was a famous cook. That
was self-evident.</p>
<p>After dinner they went out upon the porch, gazed
across the mesa bluer than ever in the afternoon
haze, and talked. Jean longed to know about school,
and they told her of St. Helen&#8217;s, of Miss King, and
Miss Wallace, of the dear funny Blackmores, and
of poor tactless Miss Green. Tears ran down Jean&#8217;s
face as Virginia told of Katrina Van Rensaelar and
the deluge she never received, and of how Priscilla
had given the German measles to the boys at the
Gordon School.</p>
<p>Then Mary begged to know something about
homesteading, and Jean told of how she had come
to Wyoming. Her far-off neighbors in the other
corner of the mesa had been friends in Montana,
she said, and it was they who had encouraged her
to come and take up an opposite claim. She explained
how the land would become her own after
she had lived upon it seven months each year for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
three years; how each year she must plow and fence
so many acres; and how at the end of that time she
could sell the land at a good price, or else stay and
improve it further.</p>
<p>&#8220;And which will you do?&#8221; asked the interested
Mary while the others listened. &#8220;Will you stay or
go away after it is yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>She would go away for a while, she told them,
and rent her land. Her neighbors yonder would be
glad to hire it. She was going to college. Her
eyes glowed with enthusiasm as she dreamed her
dream for them. Since her graduation from High
School she had taught in country schools until she
had saved money enough to pay for her improvements
on the homestead. Everything was paid for&mdash;the
cabin (she had made most of the furniture
herself), the fencing, the plowing, her stock&mdash;everything;
and there was money enough left for
fall planting, a new barn, and some sheep, and the
autumn expenses. In December, perhaps, she would
leave and earn some more money until it was time to
come back again. Then in another August she
would have a crop from her winter wheat, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
another in September from the spring planting. She
could hardly wait for the time to come when she
should really have money from a crop of her own
raising.</p>
<p>After the three years were over, and the land was
hers, if she could afford it, she was going to college.
If she did not have the money then, why she would
work until she did. She would study agriculture
at college, learn the best methods of improving the
land, and then come back to carry them out. She
would build a new house in place of the cabin, buy
some more land, and make her ranch one of the best
in all Wyoming!</p>
<p>The Vigilantes were in a new world as they listened&mdash;a
world where the only capital necessary was
ambition, enthusiasm, vigor! Something told them
that this homesteading girl was richer in many things
than they themselves; that the treasures of hard
work were quite as precious as those of wealth; and
that Jean MacDonald was finding for herself
through her own untiring labor the things most
worth-while.</p>
<p>They were silent an hour later as they left their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
new friend on the edge of the mesa, and rode down
the hills toward Elk Creek Valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s been about the happiest day I&#8217;ve ever
had in my life,&#8221; she told them, as she shook hands
all around and said good-by. &#8220;I&#8217;ve loads of things
to think about and laugh about&mdash;until you come
again. Give Siwash a looser rein, Vivian. He
won&#8217;t stumble. Good-by!&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked back as they reached the Valley level
to see Jean MacDonald and Robert Bruce silhouetted
against the sky-line, and to wave them a last good-by.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like your &#8217;Power of the West&#8217; picture in our
room at school, Virginia,&#8221; Priscilla almost whispered&mdash;&#8220;the
man on horseback with the sunset and
the mountains behind him. Just look! There!
Now she&#8217;s turned Robert, and now they&#8217;re out of
sight!&#8221;</p>
<p>That night they all sat on the porch together and
watched the sunset. A flaming pageant of color
traced and retraced its course across the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw such color,&#8221; cried Aunt Nan.
&#8220;Sometimes you think it&#8217;s saffron, and then you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
know it&#8217;s amber, and then you&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s real gold,
and&mdash;it&#8217;s changed again! See, Virginia!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know what it&#8217;s like,&#8221; said Virginia.
&#8220;Mother and I discovered it years ago when I was a
little girl. Jim took us camping once when Father
was away, and at night we had a big fire and sat
and watched it. The sunset was gorgeous like this,
I remember, and just as we were watching it and the
fire, Mother discovered what the clouds were like.
They&#8217;re like the smoke as the flames underneath
push it through the green boughs! It&#8217;s just that wonderful
color in the sky now. The next time we camp
you&#8217;ll see, Aunt Nan. It always makes me think
of the flame-colored veils which the Roman girls
used to wear on their wedding-days. Mother told
me about them that very night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think how beautiful it must be from Jean&#8217;s
cabin,&#8221; said Priscilla. &#8220;And she can see a larger
sweep of sky and mountains because she&#8217;s up higher
than we. I know she&#8217;s watching it all alone, and
maybe dreaming about college.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget her to-day,&#8221; Mary said earnestly.
&#8220;I think she&#8217;s wonderful! And, Aunt Nan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
you just know from her eyes that she&#8217;s gazed on big
stretches of country all her life. You must go with
us next time to see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than that, Mary.&#8221; The voice came
from the corner of the porch where Vivian sat apart
from the others. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than that. You don&#8217;t
just know she&#8217;s always looked at big things. You
know she&#8217;s had them inside of her all her life long!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>MISS GREEN AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I know I shouldn&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said Mary to Aunt
Nan, &#8220;but I just can&#8217;t help thinking of Anne and the
Twins. Of course, as far as Jean and Jess are concerned,
they won&#8217;t mind&mdash;they&#8217;ll think it the greatest
adventure imaginable; but Anne will be terrified,
and so will Mrs. Hill. I&#8217;m so glad Mother and I
went last summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the paper say?&#8221; asked Aunt Nan.</p>
<p>They were sitting on the porch awaiting the arrival
of Priscilla, Virginia, and Vivian, who had
walked to the road for the mail. Dick, coming on
horseback, had brought the heavier papers and packages,
and Mary was absorbed in the latest reports of
the newly declared war.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s mostly about mobilizing and the German
advance, but there are scores of incidents about
Americans unable to get money or return passages,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
or anything; and here is something about their being
made to walk across the border into Switzerland.
Dear me! I wonder just where Anne is! In Germany
somewhere, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, dear,&#8221; reassured Aunt Nan.
&#8220;There may be disagreeable things, but I&#8217;m sure our
people won&#8217;t be in any real trouble or danger.
Where are those girls anyway? They must have
sat down to read their own letters, and forgotten all
about us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come,&#8221; said Mary, looking down the
cottonwood-bordered lane. &#8220;They&#8217;re reading something
all together, and laughing. Maybe it&#8217;s a letter
from the Twins or Anne.&#8221;</p>
<p>It proved to be a veritable volume from the Blackmore
twins, Jean being the real author, but Jess
having lent her personality without stint to the incident
related.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect scream,&#8221; cried Priscilla, half-choked
with laughter as she came up the steps.
&#8220;Mary, what do you think? They&#8217;ve seen&mdash;no, I
won&#8217;t tell, Virginia, but read it quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When is it dated?&#8221; asked Mary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;July 20th,&#8221; Virginia told her. &#8220;The very day
you people came. You see, &#8217;twas too early then for
any trouble. Would you rather wait to hear it, Aunt
Nan, until you&#8217;ve read your mail?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Nan&#8217;s mail was unimportant, she said, compared
to a letter from the interesting Blackmore
twins.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a regular book,&#8221; announced Virginia, as she
settled herself against a post, and turned the pages.
&#8220;Jean probably didn&#8217;t do much sight-seeing on the
afternoon she wrote this.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Virginia and Everybody Else</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is only through Anne&#8217;s economy and Jess&#8217;
impudence and my genius at conducting a party
that we are here and writing to you. Had each
of us lacked the quality named above, we should
to-day doubtless be languishing within the walls of
a German poor-house. But instead we are in a
lovely pension&mdash;all together and unspeakably
happy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The story in itself is so thrilling that I hate
to give you the <i>necessary setting</i>, as Miss Wallace
would say, but I must. The first step is to explain
how we all happen to be together. It was this
way: Father and Jess and I <i>did</i> stay in England
for a week after all. You see, Jess had faithfully
promised every girl in English History that she
would see Lady Jane Grey&#8217;s name where she had
cut it herself in the Tower; and I had given my
oath to record the impressions made upon me by
the sight of Kenilworth by moonlight. Whether
Dad would have considered those vows worthy
or not, we do not know, had it not been that he
wanted to go to the Bodleian Library at Oxford
to see some musty old manuscript or other. So
on our way from Liverpool to Oxford we stopped
at Kenilworth, and I <i>did</i> see it at moonlight. I
shall give my impressions at a later date. The
search for another old manuscript gave Jess her
chance at the Tower and &#8220;JANE,&#8221; and it was
there in the little chapel that we met Anne and
Mrs. Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They had planned the most wonderful week
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
down in Surrey in a tiny English village called
Shere, which Anne said was, according to the
guide-books, &#8220;the perfect realization of an artist&#8217;s
dream.&#8221; She begged us to go along with them,
and poor Mrs. Hill, I suppose, felt obliged to invite
us also, though what she may have said to
Anne in private I do not yet know. We became
imbued with desire to see the artist&#8217;s dream realized
and to be with Anne, so with Jess to hurry
Mrs. Hill and me to drag Anne, we tore through
Billingsgate fish-market and up King William
Street to the Bank, where we were to meet Father.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;After the poor man had recovered from his
astonishment, he gave his consent&mdash;namely, that
we should go to Surrey with Anne and Mrs. Hill
<i>(if they really wanted us)</i> then across the channel
to Rotterdam, up the Rhine and on to Berlin,
where he would meet us. Mrs. Hill really seemed
glad to have us go with them and, to be very
frank, I think the Rev. Dr. Blackmore was glad
to get rid of us. You see, Jess and I simply can&#8217;t
get enthusiastic over the Middle Ages and old
manuscripts, and I think it worries Dad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, our learned father went on to Berlin,
and his imbecile offspring to Surrey. Shere was
lovely! <i>My</i> dream was realized at least. I&#8217;ll
never forget the little gardens filled with roses
and Canterbury bells, and the grain-fields dotted
with poppies, and the woods filled with holly and
tall pink foxgloves, and the beeches all silvery
and green. We rode bicycles all over Surrey, and
ate roast beef and Yorkshire pudding and drank
ginger beer at quaint little English inns. You&#8217;ll
hear all about it next year in English class, for
I&#8217;ve themes enough for everybody&mdash;at least material
for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then we went back to London, and had all
sorts of adventures there, from our cab-horse falling
flat in Piccadilly Circus to Jess being arrested
at the House of Commons gate; but if Mrs. Hill
ever repented of her invitation she didn&#8217;t let us
know, and we were never happier in our lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We started for Rotterdam the 14th of July,
crossed the Channel with flying colors since we
went to bed immediately upon going aboard, and
started up the Rhine the next day on a boat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
appropriately named the <i>Siegfried</i>. The first day
we went through flat Holland country, but on the
next we had reached the hills, all walled-up and
covered with vineyards. That evening we arrived
at Cologne, where we were to stay a day to see
the Cathedral, and went to our hotel. And here
the great adventure begins!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No sooner had we arrived at the hotel and
asked for mail, than the clerk handed Mrs. Hill
a telegram. It was from her music-teacher in
Berlin, and asked her to be in Berlin the next day
without fail for a lesson. What was she to do?
She said she just couldn&#8217;t miss the lesson, and yet
she just couldn&#8217;t bear to take us girls before we
had seen the Cathedral or the castles on the Rhine.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It didn&#8217;t take Jess and Anne and me long to
decide. She must go on, of course, we told her,
and we would see the Cathedral, go up the rest of
the Rhine quite by ourselves, and on by train from
Mayence to Berlin. We could see she was hesitating,
probably feeling that Anne might be
trusted, but not being exactly sure of those Blackmore
twins.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;The language?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your German?
You may not find English spoken everywhere, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Anne hastened to remark that I had studied
German for three years, and carried off honors.
Her imagination gave birth to the honors, whereupon
I, wishing above all else to play my part,
cleared my throat, thought a moment, and requested
the clerk to bring me a glass of water,
which he did with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whether my visible success reassured Mrs.
Hill or not, I do not know, but anyhow she departed
that night for Berlin, leaving us loaded
with endless instructions, extra money, and a tiny
red German dictionary. I never felt so officious
in my life as when I called a cab and ushered
Jess and Anne into it after the train had pulled
out. I can see now why it is that Thomas Cook
and Son have been so eminently successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The next day we spent browsing around in
the Cathedral. To describe it would be out of
place in this letter, which deals primarily with
adventure. I might say, however, that Jess bought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
all of you silver pendants of the Three Wise Men
of Cologne, when she ought to have saved her
money. That evening we took the Rhine-boat&mdash;the
<i>Parsifal</i> this time&mdash;and when we awoke in the
morning we were well among the castles. It was
a marvelous day, and I&#8217;ll have loads to tell you
about it in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We reached Mayence in the evening in a
pouring rain, and took a cab, driven by a funny,
red-faced driver, to a hotel where English was
spoken, for however Mrs. Hill may have been
impressed by my honors in German she had taken
care to recommend English hotels. Our train for
Berlin was to leave at nine A.M., so we went to
bed early, feeling too self-resourceful for words.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you remember how, with cheers for St.
Helen&#8217;s and groans for Athens, we bequeathed
Greenie to the Ancient World last winter? Who
at that joyous moment would have thought that
she would again and so soon enter our lives?
Imagine then, if you can, the chill of horror which
shook us all when upon alighting at the Mayence
station the next morning, ready to take our train
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
for Berlin, we beheld&mdash;<i>unmistakably beheld</i>&mdash;our
beloved Greenie by the drinking-fountain!!! Her
back was toward us, and all the proofs we had at
that moment were the hang of her familiar gray
suit, and our old friend, that absurd chicken
feather, awry upon her little, black, St. Helen&#8217;s
hat. We stood breathless and surveyed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;It is!&#8221; said Jess. &#8220;Let&#8217;s run!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;It&#8217;s not!&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;She&#8217;s in Athens.
Besides, she&#8217;s too antiseptic to drink at a fountain!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I believe it is,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It&#8217;s just as well to
look for shelter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Of course, it is,&#8221; said Jess. &#8220;That chicken-feather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And just then she looked up! There was no
longer any question as to identity. In spite of
drinking-fountains and Athens, it was Greenie!
She looked quite the same as ever, except for the
absence of the gray shawl, and no visible effects of
curl-papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whether it was Providence, Greenie&#8217;s near-sightedness
or our own speed that saved us, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
don&#8217;t know; but I do know we took her bearings
and all ran in opposite directions. She was going
through the door marked <i>South</i>. Anne accordingly
ran north, Jess east, and I west.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Meet in five minutes at the fountain,&#8221; I
commanded hoarsely as we separated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That was the last we saw of Greenie&#8217;s visible
form. How she happened to be in Mayence we
knew not. Jess insisted she never reached Athens
at all, but was discovered en route at Mayence,
placed in the Museum there, and was simply out
on parole for exercise! Be that as it may, the
excitement of seeing her, and the flight which
followed, proved most disastrous to us all, for
when we met five minutes later at the fountain,
the Blackmore purse, carried by Jess, was
gone!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Anne and I stood and glared at my poor twin
just as though dropping a purse were a disgrace
which could never come to us even when escaping
from Miss Green. I informed her of a fact
which she has known for eighteen years&mdash;namely,
that twenty dollars, the amount in the purse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
might be a trifle to some, but was colossal in the
eyes of a minister&#8217;s family. Anne was less scathing,
but by no means charitable. Poor Jess, on
the verge of tears, suggested that instead of scolding
her we&#8217;d better look for the purse, which we
proceeded to do without success.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thereupon Anne counted her money, my
honors in German of course being a constant help.
A twenty mark piece&mdash;five dollars; a ten mark
piece&mdash;two dollars and a half; and some change
amounting to four marks or another dollar.
Eight dollars and fifty cents in all, and three persons,
who had had no breakfast, must be transported
to Berlin!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; said Anne.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be done!&#8221; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;If I have to beg on the streets, it <i>shall</i> be
done!&#8221; cried Jess, so loudly that every one in the
station looked in our direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;How much are the tickets?&#8221; asked Anne.
&#8220;Mother said to go second-class in Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said I officiously, and started toward
a blue-capped official in a cage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;You&#8217;d best hurry,&#8221; cried Anne. &#8220;The train
goes in twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I smiled upon the somber man in the cage
and asked in my best and clearest English how
much the tickets were. A blank stare was his only
answer. He understood no English, and to save
my life I could think of no German. I stammered
and stammered but with no success, and in
a few seconds a fat German lady with six children
and a dog had unceremoniously pushed me
out of the way. I tried another official and another
with the same result. A helpless feeling
seized me. I looked at the clock. Five minutes
out of the twenty gone! I ran back frantically
to Jess and Anne, snatched the little red dictionary,
and was off again in search of still another
official. This time I was understood, bad as was
my German, but <i>I</i> couldn&#8217;t understand, so things
were as hopeless as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ten minutes before train time I returned
desperate to my twin and Anne, and confessed
that honors in German were of no assistance
whatsoever. We gazed at one another blankly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
Money gone&mdash;hope gone&mdash;what should we do?
At that moment Jess darted away. Our first
thought was that she had spied Miss Green, and
was leaving us to our fate for revenge; but a moment
later we saw that she had seized upon a tall
man, who had been quietly crossing the platform.
Her impudence was appalling! She grabbed the
man by the arm without a word of explanation,
and literally dragged him toward us. I don&#8217;t
think she had spoken to him at all until she
reached Anne and me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Here,&#8221; she said, pointing a finger of scorn
at me, &#8220;here is my sister who is supposed to know
German and doesn&#8217;t. She&#8217;ll tell you how you can
help us out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The man, who wore a Thomas Cook and Son
hat, was very polite after he had recovered from
his surprise. I explained the difficulty we were
in as quickly as possible, and he, in turn, said
that second-class tickets to Berlin cost in the
neighborhood of four dollars, that the train left
in seven minutes, and that if we would give him
the money he would gladly make the purchase.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Four dollars!&#8221; gasped Anne. &#8220;Apiece, you
mean, or together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Apiece,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Then we can&#8217;t go,&#8221; said Anne. &#8220;I knew
it all the time.&#8221; And she dropped in a limp little
heap on the bench near by just as though she
never could get up.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked the man.
&#8220;Out of money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then Jess, who was really to blame, felt
called upon to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Yes, sir, we are,&#8221; she said, &#8220;all but eight
dollars and fifty cents. You see, we experienced
a severe shock in seeing G&mdash;&mdash; Miss Green, an
old teacher of ours, by the drinking-fountain,
when we thought she was in Athens. We didn&#8217;t
feel as though we could speak to her until&mdash;until
we had washed and brushed up a little, and so
we&mdash;well, we ran, and somehow I lost our family
purse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He seemed very interested all of a sudden,
and said we needn&#8217;t worry at all if we had eight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
dollars and a half. There was another train leaving
an hour later, he said&mdash;a train which carried
third-class carriages. We would be quite
safe in traveling that way, and he would personally
see us on board, if we wished. At that Anne
and her spirits arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Miss Green,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;You say she
was your teacher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I wonderingly. &#8220;She most certainly
was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Harriet, her given name?&#8221; asked the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Yes!&#8221; cried Jess and Anne and I all together.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know her, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;An angular person in a gray suit?&#8221; he
continued. &#8220;Wears spectacles and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Crimps,&#8221; interrupted Jess. &#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s
the one, though she hasn&#8217;t any this morning.
You see, at school she always was a little&mdash;well,
formidable, and we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the man again. &#8220;Well, since I
know she&#8217;s around here, I may as well wait. I
told her to be at our office just outside the station
at ten o&#8217;clock, and it&#8217;s nearly that now. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
see,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;she&#8217;s been in Athens for six
months, and she&#8217;s very anxious to conduct a small
party back there&mdash;lecture on the ancient civilization
and all that sort of thing, you know. Perhaps,
since she was your teacher, you&#8217;ll be able
to tell me how she&#8217;d do. She hasn&#8217;t had time
to get recommendations for just this sort of work,
you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;How&mdash;how long would she be gone?&#8221; ventured
Jess.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Well,&#8221; explained the Thomas Cook man,
&#8220;if she did well, we&#8217;d probably keep her on the
force. We&#8217;re always looking for folks like that&mdash;to
take parties&mdash;especially to Athens or Egypt.
They&#8217;re rare! This might be a life job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I&#8217;d be willing to recommend her!&#8221; said
Jess, a little too promptly, I thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Anne, &#8220;it depends a good
deal on the party she&#8217;s going to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;It certainly does,&#8221; I agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the man again, &#8220;it&#8217;s an easy
party. There&#8217;s a professor who&#8217;s nearly eighty,
and who&#8217;s wanted all his life to go to Athens;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
and a minister who&#8217;s trying to discover the exact
spot where Paul preached to the Athenians; and
a couple of teachers who are something like Miss
Green, I think&mdash;about that type, you know.
They&#8217;re terribly interested in the temples on the
Acropolis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Miss Green then is certainly the woman
for you, sir,&#8221; I announced, feeling like an Employment
Bureau. &#8220;She&#8217;s steeped in the Ancient
World! She dotes on Rameses and the Pharaohs
and the Tarquins and Solon; and she knows more
about every one of them than she knows about&mdash;us,
for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;The only reason we hesitated for a moment,&#8221;
added Anne, &#8220;was because we thought
the party might be composed of young people,
and, you see, Miss Green has never specialized
to any great extent in&mdash;in&mdash;young life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I understand perfectly,&#8221; said our benefactor.
&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll run along, young ladies.
She might be in my office. Get your tickets from
the man in the red cap at the largest window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
over there. He speaks English. Your train will
reach Berlin at seven. It&#8217;s on track four. Don&#8217;t
thank me at all. I&#8217;m indebted to you. Won&#8217;t
you walk to the office and see Miss Green? She&#8217;d
be delighted, I&#8217;m sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Anne answered for us. &#8220;No, thank you,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we can&#8217;t. We haven&#8217;t had
breakfast yet, and we must telegraph my mother.
She&#8217;ll expect us earlier. Yes, thank you, I&#8217;m sure
we can manage quite well alone. Give Miss
Green our best regards. I&#8217;m sure we hope she&#8217;ll
be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He shook hands all around.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;You really think,&#8221; asked Jess, a little worried
in tone, I thought, &#8220;you really think it&#8217;s
likely to be a job for life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;I do. I think she&#8217;s
the very woman I&#8217;ve been looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then he went. We stood looking at one another,
not knowing what to say. It had all been
too unexpected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jess at last, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but
that a job for life is cheap at twenty dollars. And,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
you know, she really expected to return to St.
Helen&#8217;s year after next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We had just time to eat our belated breakfast,
telegraph, buy our tickets, and catch the
ten o&#8217;clock train, which carried us to Berlin without
incident, other than embarrassments arising
from my total lack of German. We didn&#8217;t mind
third class at all. It&#8217;s a lot more human. Mrs.
Hill and Dad met us, and Dad forgot all about the
twenty dollars when we told him about Greenie.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve given up seeing the Emperor&#8217;s stables
to tell you all of this, and I hope you appreciate
it. Jess and Anne send loads of love to all of
you, and so do I. I can&#8217;t believe Wyoming is
any better than Germany!</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help wondering, Virginia,&#8221; said Priscilla,
after they had all laughed again over Jean&#8217;s letter,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t help wondering whether Greenie will consider
<i>this</i> vocation thrust upon her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I was wondering, too,&#8221; returned
Virginia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE VIGILANTES HOMESTEAD</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;John, do you really think it&#8217;s safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Aunt Nan who asked the question. Mr.
Hunter laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe, Nan? They couldn&#8217;t be safer. There&#8217;s
nothing in the wide world to hurt them out there
on the mesa. They&#8217;re safer there, in my opinion,
than any place I know, and if they want to know
what homesteading is like, why let them homestead
for a night! It won&#8217;t hurt them a bit. If they
go back to school with a few of Jean MacDonald&#8217;s
ideas, they&#8217;ll be very fortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as though I ought to go,&#8221; said Aunt
Nan, &#8220;and still I don&#8217;t know that my being there
would do any good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; returned Virginia&#8217;s father. &#8220;Roughing
it at seventeen and thirty are two entirely different
experiences. Stay at home and be civilized,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
but let them go and don&#8217;t worry for a moment.
They&#8217;ll show up to-morrow safe and sound with
another bran-new experience for their Thought
Books. See if they don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>So it happened that Aunt Nan was convinced and
gave her consent to Virginia&#8217;s just-born and dearly-beloved
plan&mdash;namely, that the four Vigilantes
should homestead for Jean MacDonald during
her absence of one night from her cabin on the
mesa. Jean had ridden over that morning on her
way to town to spend the night with a friend, and
Virginia&#8217;s plan had sprung full-born like Athena
from the head of Zeus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want us to homestead for you, Jean,
while you&#8217;re away?&#8221; she had asked.</p>
<p>Jean had gladly accepted the offer. &#8220;It would be
just the thing,&#8221; she said. Then they could really
see why she loved the mesa as she did, and especially
her very own corner of it. The dogs would
be glad of company, for she had driven the three
cows that very morning to the neighboring homestead,
and except for the chickens, Watch and King
were all alone. The cabin door had no lock, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
they might go right in and make themselves at home.
There was an extra cot in the kitchen, bedding in
plenty, and loads of food supplies. She would simply
love to have them do it!</p>
<p>Virginia had turned questioningly to the listening
Vigilantes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s!&#8221; said Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do let&#8217;s!&#8221; cried Priscilla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; faltered Vivian, insuperably buoyed
up by company.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jean MacDonald as she turned
Robert Bruce toward the road. &#8220;It&#8217;s settled then!
There&#8217;s plenty of butter and milk in the creek-refrigerator&mdash;I
left them there&mdash;and lots of fish in
the creek. You&#8217;ll have to rustle your own
wood, I guess. Help yourselves to everything!
Good-by!&#8221;</p>
<p>William, who was working among his flowers,
had waited only for Aunt Nan&#8217;s approval. Now
that it had come, he was off to saddle the horses,
while the excited Vigilantes flew to get into their
riding-clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you dared to suggest it, Virginia,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
said Priscilla, struggling with her boot lacings. &#8220;I
thought of it, too&mdash;that&#8217;s what I meant by nudging
you&mdash;but, of course, I wouldn&#8217;t have liked to propose
it. In the two weeks I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve had
the best time I ever had in my life, and I really
believe this is going to be the best of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; observed Virginia, &#8220;that the boys
will be more or less disappointed because we won&#8217;t
be here to go on the gopher hunt, but we can shoot
dozens of gophers any day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; returned Vivian, who had never
shot one in her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; echoed Mary, who was in the same
class with Vivian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; continued Priscilla, &#8220;the experience of
shooting a gopher, while doubtless thrilling in the
extreme, doesn&#8217;t compare for one moment with
homesteading. Do you know, girls, I believe I&#8217;ll
take along my Thought Book. Something might
come to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, if I were you,&#8221; acquiesced Virginia.
&#8220;No, Hannah, dear,&#8221; she added, turning to the faithful
retainer in the doorway, &#8220;we don&#8217;t want a thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
to eat. Thank you just as much. It wouldn&#8217;t be
homesteading at all if we carried food. Jean says
there are plenty of supplies out there. We&#8217;re just
going to take our night-dresses and combs and
tooth-brushes and Priscilla&#8217;s Thought Book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hannah smiled dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supplies is all right, deary,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but who&#8217;s
going to cook them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make biscuits, I think,&#8221; offered Mary. &#8220;At
least, I did once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia thought for a moment, uncertain of
her contribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can fry fish,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
you do it a hundred times, Hannah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Priscilla and Vivian, not being culinary experts,
made no promises; but Virginia, even in the face
of discouragement, still insisted that they take
nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t go till after dinner,&#8221; called Aunt
Nan from her room. &#8220;It will be ready in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait,&#8221; reiterated Mr. Hunter. &#8220;William&#8217;s
had to go on the range a piece for the horses, anyway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>So it was after dinner that the four homesteaders
started for their borrowed claim, leaving
behind three disgusted boys armed for a gopher
hunt, an amused father, an interested William,
a still doubtful Aunt Nan, and a much-worried
Hannah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we even come to call?&#8221; asked Carver, holding
Vivian&#8217;s horse for her to mount.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Carver,&#8221; said Virginia sweetly, &#8220;you can&#8217;t.
We want to see how it will really seem to be homesteading
all alone. We&#8217;ll be back by noon to-morrow,
and will go after gophers in the afternoon,
if you want to wait. If you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not invite us to supper?&#8221; suggested Donald.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll go directly afterward, and won&#8217;t come
too early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; cried Priscilla, much to Hannah&#8217;s
amusement as they galloped away. &#8220;Supper
is to be an experiment for us, and we don&#8217;t want
any guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode south through the hills to Elk Creek
Valley, where the pink and blue of the blossoms
were fading a little in the August sun. It would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
be a golden Valley soon, Virginia said&mdash;yellow with
sunflowers and golden-rod. Then they climbed
the foot-hills to the mesa, and rode eagerly
toward their newly-acquired cabin in the southwest
corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel exactly like the owner,&#8221; confided Virginia,
urging Pedro forward toward their goal.
&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering if anything has happened since my
trip to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently nothing had happened. The cabin
was slumbering peacefully in the August sunshine.
Watch and King, however, were wide awake. They
came bounding around the corner of the house,
ready to guard their mistress&#8217; property from all
intruders. But in their superior dog wisdom they
soon remembered that these young ladies were the
friends who a few days before had made their mistress
happy, and they gave the Vigilantes a royal
welcome&mdash;both for Jean and for themselves.</p>
<p>Virginia considered matters for a moment before
dismounting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll leave Pedro&#8217;s bridle on,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Then he won&#8217;t stray far, and the others will keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
near him. We&#8217;ll unsaddle and put the things on
the porch. Then that will be done. It&#8217;s three
o&#8217;clock now,&#8221; she continued, consulting her watch,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t think it would be a bad plan to get
settled and consider supper, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they did not, they told her, as they dismounted.
Virginia, with Pedro unsaddled and
eager to feed, proudly watched Vivian as she tugged
at Siwash&#8217;s saddle-straps, and took off his bridle.
It was some time since Vivian had asked assistance.
Her heart might be beating fearfully inside&mdash;it
probably was&mdash;when Siwash shook his head impatiently
and stamped a foot; but only an instinctive
backward movement proved that the fear was still
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vivian&#8217;s making new roots every day,&#8221; Virginia
said to herself, &#8220;and deep ones, too.&#8221; And
she smiled encouragingly into Vivian&#8217;s blue eyes, as,
the horses freed, they carried the saddles, blankets,
and bridles to the porch.</p>
<p>Jean MacDonald was right. The cabin door
would not lock. Three Vigilantes looked somewhat
askance at one another when this fact was made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
known, though the fourth seemed not to consider
it at all. The cot in the kitchen was examined and
pronounced comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least as comfortable as one would wish,
homesteading for one night,&#8221; said Priscilla.</p>
<p>Lots were drawn for beds and companions.
Vivian and Virginia, it was thus decided, should
sleep in the living-room, and Priscilla and Mary
in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we could move the kitchen cot into
the living-room,&#8221; said Virginia, &#8220;but it really isn&#8217;t
worth the trouble where the door is so small. Besides,
you girls don&#8217;t feel the least bit frightened
about sleeping out there, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary looked at Priscilla and Priscilla looked at
Mary. Not for veritable worlds would they have
confided to Virginia the joy which would fill their
hearts if that refractory kitchen cot could be moved
into the living-room; not for untold riches would
they have confessed the sinking feeling which attacked
them upon the thought of sleeping in the
kitchen nearest that unlocked door. A bear might
push open that door, or a mountain lion roar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
outside their window&mdash;they would be game to the
end!</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; announced Virginia, quite unconscious of
the sensations which were agitating her friends, &#8220;I
think we&#8217;d best begin to get supper. It may take
some time. Mary, I see there&#8217;s a cook book in
the kitchen. If you&#8217;ve made biscuits only once,
it might be well for you to study up a little. Vivian
can set the table, and get some lettuce from the
garden. I&#8217;ll rustle the wood for the fire, and get
the potatoes ready. Hannah told me to bake them
about an hour. Priscilla, why don&#8217;t you take one
of Jean&#8217;s rods and follow up the creek? There are
some quaking-asps in a shady place up a little way,
and it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if you got a trout
there. Use some of those little dark flies&mdash;they&#8217;re
good this kind of a day. Come to think of it, Jean
has some already on. You might add a grasshopper
or two. There&#8217;ll be plenty of them hopping
around. Pinch their noses and they&#8217;ll keep still.&#8221;</p>
<p>Priscilla, armed with Virginia&#8217;s directions, and
a total lack of experience, took the rod and went
her way. Never in her life had she caught a fish,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
but the zest of a possible catch seized her. If she
could only get one, it would be something more to
tell Alden, and might elicit praise as high as the
bear-trapping experience had done. She saw the
quaking-asps some rods above the cabin, crawled
under the wire fence, and went toward them. Something
hopped out of her way. A grasshopper! She
jumped, but missed him! Personally she did not
care for the <i>feel</i> of grasshoppers, and their kindred
of crawly things, but if she would accomplish her
purpose, she must procure one. She dropped on her
knees, and began her search. There were grasshoppers
in plenty, but they were of a very swift
variety. Priscilla darted and dove on this side and
that before she finally caught her prey. With loathing
and disgust she proceeded to pinch his nose
and render him helpless. She placed him awkwardly
and none too securely on the hook beneath
the little black fly, strode to the quaking-asps, disentangled
her rod and line a dozen times, and at
length managed to drop the baited hook into the
creek. Then she straightened her weary form,
grasped her rod firmly in her right hand and waited.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
The question was&mdash;should she do anything more
than wait? Were one&#8217;s chances of success greater
if she wiggled the rod? Should one just stand still
or walk back and forth, dragging the line after
her?</p>
<p>If the trout in the dark pool under the shadow
of the quaking-asps had seen the performance that
preceded the appearance of that fly and grasshopper,
he never would have deigned to approach them. But
his late afternoon nap had fortunately prevented,
and now supper was before his very eyes. He darted
for the grasshopper and securely seized it. Priscilla,
standing motionless upon the bank, felt a
tremor go through the rod in her hand, saw the tip
bend, felt a frightful tug as the fish darted downstream.
Something told her that her dream was
realized&mdash;that she had at least <i>hooked</i> a fish!</p>
<p>Had the fish in question been less greedy, he would
have assuredly made his escape. Priscilla knew
nothing of the rules of angling. She only knew
that she should never recover from chagrin and
shame if that fish eluded her. She dropped the rod,
grasped the line tightly in both hands, slid down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
the bank, stood in the creek to her boot-tops, and
pulled with all her might. The trout, hindered by
surprise as well as greediness, surrendered, and Priscilla
with trembling hands and glowing eyes drew
him to shore.</p>
<p>It never occurred to her to take him from the
hook. Her one thought was to notify the Vigilantes
of her success. Holding the line in one hand, just
above the flapping, defeated trout, and grasping
the rod in the other, she ran with all her might to
the cabin, burst in the door, and exhibited her fish
and her dripping, triumphant self to the Vigilantes.
Fears of unlocked doors had fled! It was still light,
and she was a conqueror!</p>
<p>Supper that night, in spite of Hannah&#8217;s fears,
was an unqualified success. Memory and the cook-book
had sufficed to make very creditable biscuits,
the trout, rather demolished by vigorous cleaning,
lay, brown and sizzling, in a nest of fresh lettuce
leaves, and the potatoes were perfect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fun?&#8221; cried Virginia, as they ate the last
crumb. &#8220;It&#8217;s better even than I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lovely,&#8221; said Vivian, &#8220;only I feel just the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
same way that I did about staying all alone as Jean
does. Look outside, Virginia. It&#8217;s getting dark
already!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Virginia, going to the window,
&#8220;it does in August, though the twilights stay like
this a long time. See, there&#8217;s a star! Doesn&#8217;t it
twinkle? You can actually see the points! Let&#8217;s
wish on it. I wish&mdash;let me see&mdash;I wish for the
loveliest year at St. Helen&#8217;s we could possibly have&mdash;a
year we&#8217;ll remember all our lives!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;that college may be just
as lovely, and that I&#8217;ll make as good new friends
as you all are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Priscilla thoughtfully, &#8220;I wish I
may be just as good a Senior Monitor as you were,
Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to tell my wish,&#8221; said Vivian
softly. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s too much about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dishes were washed and dogs and chickens fed.
Then they came out-of-doors in the ever-deepening
stillness to watch the moon rise over the blue shadowy
mountains, and look down upon the mesa, upon
the horses feeding some rods away among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
sagebrush, and upon them as they stood together a little
distance from the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it still?&#8221; whispered Vivian, holding Virginia&#8217;s
hand. &#8220;You can just hear the silence in your
ears. I believe it&#8217;s louder than the creek!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it!&#8221; said Mary, unlocked doors all forgotten
in a blessed, all-together feeling. &#8220;See the
stars come out one by one. You can almost see
them opening the doors of Heaven before they look
through. I never saw so many in all my life. And
isn&#8217;t the sky blue? It&#8217;s never that way at home!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand better than ever, Virginia,&#8221; said
Priscilla, &#8220;how you used to feel at school when
we would open the French doors and go out on
the porch. You said it wasn&#8217;t satisfying someway.
I thought I understood on the getting-acquainted
trip, but now I know better than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes you feel like whispering, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Vivian whispered again. &#8220;It&#8217;s all so big and we&#8217;re
so little. But it doesn&#8217;t scare me so much now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; said Virginia softly, &#8220;of
Matthew Arnold&#8217;s poem&mdash;the one on <i>Self-Dependence</i>,
you know, Vivian, which we had in class, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
which Miss Wallace likes so much. Of course, he
was on the sea when he thought of it, but so are
we&mdash;on a prairie sea&mdash;and I&#8217;m sure the stars were
never brighter, even there. I learned it because I
think it expresses the way one feels out here. I
used to feel little, too, Vivian, but I don&#8217;t any more.
I feel just as though some strange thing inside of
me were trying to reach the stars. It&#8217;s just as
though all the little things that have bothered you
were gone away&mdash;just as though you were ready
to learn <i>real</i> things from the stars and the silence
and the mountains&mdash;learn how to be like them, I
mean. You know what he said in the poem, Vivian&mdash;the
stanza about the stars&mdash;the one Miss Wallace
loves the best:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;Unaffrighted by the silence round them,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Undistracted by the sights they see,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>These demand not that the things without them</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Vivian sighed&mdash;a long, deep sigh that somehow
drew them closer together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll ever be like that,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll always want sympathy and&mdash;love!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t mean that, Vivian,&#8221; explained
Virginia. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t. Of course, we all
want those things&mdash;more than anything else in the
world. But I think it means just as Miss Wallace
said, that instead of demanding them we&#8217;re to live
so&mdash;so nobly that they will come to us&mdash;unsought,
you know. Doesn&#8217;t that make it a little easier, don&#8217;t
you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>The August night grew cold, and soon they went
indoors to a friendship fire in the stone fire-place.
They watched the flames roar up the chimney, then
crackle cheerily, and at last flicker away to little
blue tongues, which died almost as soon as they were
born. There was no other light in the cabin. Virginia
had said that none was needed, and she did
not notice the apprehensive glances which the other
Vigilantes cast around the shadowy, half-lit room.
At last Vivian yawned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Virginia. &#8220;Bed-time! I
guess we can see to undress by moonlight, can&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do about the door?&#8221; asked Mary
hesitatingly. &#8220;It won&#8217;t lock, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Virginia carelessly,
while she covered the fire-brands with ashes.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no one in the world around. Besides,
Watch and King will take care of things. You
don&#8217;t feel afraid, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; announced Priscilla, trying her best
to ape Virginia&#8217;s careless manner, and determined
to <i>act</i> like a good sport at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; echoed Mary faintly.</p>
<p>Vivian was unspeakably glad that her lot had
fallen with Virginia, and that their bed was in
the farther corner of the living-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish Dorothy were here!&#8221; Virginia called
fifteen minutes later to the brave souls on the kitchen
cot. &#8220;Then &#8217;twould be perfectly perfect. Good-night,
everybody. Sweet dreams!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweet dreams!&#8221; whispered Priscilla to Mary,
while she clutched Mary&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect
to have a dream to-night! Mary, don&#8217;t go to sleep
before I do! We&#8217;ll have to manage it somehow!
I&#8217;ll die if you do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; promised Mary.</p>
<p>But they were tired from excitement, and sleep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
came in spite of unlocked doors. A half hour
passed and every homesteader was sleeping soundly.
The night wore on, midnight passed, and the still,
stiller hours of the early morning came. It was
yet dark when Mary was rudely awakened by her
roommate kicking her with all her might. She sat
up in bed, dazed, frightened. Priscilla was clinging
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mary!&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;Listen! There are
footsteps outside our window! There are, I tell
you! Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary listened. Her heart was in her mouth and
choking her. Yes, there were unmistakably footsteps
outside. As they listened, the sound of breathing
became apparent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>isn&#8217;t</i> our breathing, Mary,&#8221; Priscilla whispered.
&#8220;I tell you it <i>isn&#8217;t!</i> It&#8217;s&mdash;oh, the steps are
coming nearer! They&#8217;re on the path! Oh, Virginia!
V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a! V-I-R-G-I-N-I-A!!&#8221;</p>
<p>The last word ended in a mighty shout, which
awoke Virginia and the terrified Vivian. Before
the shout was fairly completed, the cot in the living-room
was groaning beneath an added weight, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Virginia, striving to rise, was encumbered by three
pair of arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go, girls!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Let me go, I
tell you! No one&#8217;s coming into this cabin unless
I say so! Remember that!&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time the steps were on the porch. Virginia,
finally free from embraces and on her feet,
reached for Jean MacDonald&#8217;s gun, and started for
the door, which she was just too late to open. Instead,
the visitor from without pushed it open, and
the terrified Vigilantes on the bed, hearing Virginia
laugh, raised their frightened heads from the
pillows to meet the astonished gaze of poor old
Siwash!</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever let the boys know,&#8221; warned Virginia,
as she returned from escorting Siwash to the
gate and out upon the mesa. &#8220;We&#8217;ll never hear
the last of it if you do. &#8217;Twas our own fault. We
didn&#8217;t close the gate, that&#8217;s all, and Siwash has always
loved company!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the boys never knew, though they wondered
not a little at the significant and secret glances which
the Vigilantes exchanged upon their arrival home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
the next morning, and at intervals during the days
that followed whenever homesteading became the
topic of conversation. Once Aunt Nan, to whom
also the secret was denied, attempted to probe the
mystery, choosing Vivian as the most likely source
of information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you really have a splendid time, Vivian?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly did, Aunt Nan,&#8221; answered the loyal
Vivian. &#8220;I never had a better time in all my life.
Only one night of homesteading is enough for me.
There are lots of things I envy Jean MacDonald,
but homesteading isn&#8217;t one of them!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AUNT DEBORAH HUNTER&mdash;PIONEER</h3>
</div>

<p>Aunt Deborah Hunter was driving from her
ranch on Snake Creek to spend the day with her
nephew, her grand-niece, and her grand-niece&#8217;s
guests. Clad in her best black silk dress, her black
bonnet with the red cherries on the front, and her
well-darned black cotton gloves, she was sitting
up, very straight and stiff, beside Alec on the front
seat. One would have said that her dignity forbade
her to rest her shoulders, doubtless tired from the
fifteen mile drive. Still, it was not altogether dignity
which made Aunt Deborah scorn the support
of the cushions which Alec had placed behind her.
A great part of it was eagerness.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since she had left her
ranch even for a day. No one there could attend
to things quite so well as she herself, she always
insisted. But now, between shearing and threshing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
she had chosen a day upon which to accept
Virginia&#8217;s and her father&#8217;s oft-repeated invitation,
and it was a festive occasion for her. Truth to tell,
she needed one day a year, she said, &#8220;to meet folks.&#8221;
For the remaining three hundred and sixty-four, the
hired man, her two dogs, an occasional visitor,
her thoughts, and the mountains were quite
enough.</p>
<p>If the infrequent passer-by had paused long
enough to look into Aunt Deborah&#8217;s gray eyes beneath
the cherry-trimmed bonnet, he would have
seen therein the eagerness that made their owner
scorn the sofa-pillows. It sparkled and beamed,
now on this side, now on that, as she spied blue
gentians blossoming in a hollow, and the gold which
was already creeping over the wheat; it glowed as
she looked at the mountains, and shone as she drew
long breaths of the clear, bracing air; it was the
self-same eagerness which lay deep in the gray eyes
of her grand-niece Virginia.</p>
<p>As they drew near their journey&#8217;s end, and came
in sight of the white ranch-house behind the cottonwoods,
Aunt Deborah made her final preparations.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
With her handkerchief she brushed every
speck of dust from her black dress, settled the
old-fashioned brooch at her neck, gave a final
straightening to her bonnet, and pulled her cotton
gloves on more smoothly before again folding her
hands on her lap. She sat up straighter than ever
as Alec turned the horse down the lane.</p>
<p>She seemed a little troubled about something
when she saw the group of young people gathered
at the porch and waiting for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alec,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;the cherries on my bonnet?
They worry me. I want to be young, but
being long toward eighty I mustn&#8217;t be childish.
What do you think, Alec? I wouldn&#8217;t displease Virginia
for anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t be nicer, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; reassured Alec.
&#8220;You need &#8217;em for a touch o&#8217; life to your black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus assured, the little old lady sat in state,
her eyes glowing and her folded hands trembling
with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, John,&#8221; she said a few moments later, as
she declined Mr. Hunter&#8217;s outstretched arms. &#8220;No,
thank you. When I get so I have to be lifted out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
I&#8217;m not coming any more. Turn just a little more,
Alec. There! Here I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was her grand-niece whom she greeted first.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear!&#8221; she cried, holding the tall, gray-eyed
girl at arms&#8217; length. &#8220;How you grow! John,
she&#8217;s grown an inch since she rode over a month
ago. I believe upon my soul she has. And looks
more like you every day! Kiss your old aunt, dear!
She&#8217;s plum proud of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she turned to the others, whom Virginia
proudly introduced one by one.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a blessed sight&mdash;all these young folks together,&#8221;
she said, shaking hands with them all. &#8220;Except
for Pioneer Reunions, I haven&#8217;t seen so many
all to once for fifty years. And so you all come
from away back East&mdash;the place we used to call
home? It ain&#8217;t that any longer to us old folks&mdash;but
the memories are dear all the same!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped briskly upon the porch and toward
the chair Virginia had placed for her. The Vigilantes
and Aunt Nan watched her, fascinated. Virginia
had told them of her wedding journey across
the plains in &#8217;64; of the hardships and dangers she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
had withstood; of lonely winter days in a sod hut,
and of frightful perils from Indians. She seemed
so little someway sitting there, so frail and wrinkled
in the big chair. It was almost incredible that
she had lived through such terrible things. They
longed to hear the story of it all from her own lips.
Virginia&#8217;s recital was thrilling enough! What then
must Aunt Deborah&#8217;s be?</p>
<p>But Aunt Deborah was in no haste to talk about
herself! She was far more interested in Virginia&#8217;s
friends&mdash;their respective homes and families&mdash;their
school life and their plans and dreams for the
future. Somehow the Vigilantes found it the easiest
thing in the world to tell Aunt Deborah their ambitions.
Aunt Nan found it easy, too, to speak of
Virginia&#8217;s mother to this dear old lady who had
known and loved her. Virginia held Aunt Nan&#8217;s
hand close in her own as they heard Aunt Deborah
tell of Mary Webster&#8217;s coming to Wyoming; then
a far rougher land than now; of her brave fight
against homesickness; of her transformation of the
Buffalo Horn School; and, finally, of the fierce struggle
within herself over whether she should return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
to Vermont or stay to marry a Wyoming ranchman.</p>
<p>&#8220;My nephew John,&#8221; finished Aunt Deborah
proudly. &#8220;A good man. None other than a good
man could have won Mary Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad she stayed!&#8221; cried Aunt Nan,
a big lump in her throat and her eyes brimming with
tears. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad&mdash;Aunt Deborah!&#8221; She took
one of the little old lady&#8217;s hands in hers. &#8220;We&#8217;re
all together now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;New England and the
West. There&#8217;s no difference any longer, is there,
Virginia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Aunt Nan,&#8221; said Virginia, choking down the
lump in her own throat. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a bit of difference.
And somehow I&#8217;m sure Mother knows.
Aren&#8217;t you, Aunt Deborah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something inside of me says that she does,&#8221; said
Aunt Deborah softly. &#8220;You see, dears, even Heaven
can&#8217;t blot out the lovely things of earth! At least,
that&#8217;s how it seems to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later, and Mr. Hunter came around the
corner of the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; cried Aunt Deborah gayly, &#8220;don&#8217;t let&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
worry one bit about this old world! With these
young folks to write the books, and teach the schools,
and take care of the homeless babies, we&#8217;re safe
for years to come! Come and tell me all about the
wheat.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the morning passed, and at noon Malcolm and
Donald, Jack and Carver rode over for dinner, and
for Aunt Deborah&#8217;s stories, which Virginia had
promised them. Aunt Deborah&#8217;s talent for listening
won them also, and they told her their ambitions
quite as eagerly as the Vigilantes had done.
All but Malcolm&mdash;he was strangely silent! Dinner
was served on the lawn beneath the cottonwoods.
Joe and Dick brought out the large table,
which was soon set by Hannah and her four eager
assistants. It was a jolly meal, quite the merriest
person being Aunt Deborah.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be so bad to grow old if you could
be sure of being like that, would it?&#8221; whispered Carver
Standish III to Malcolm.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Malcolm absent-mindedly, looking at
Aunt Nan. &#8220;No, it wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Aunt Deborah,&#8221; began Virginia, when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
things were cleared away, &#8220;you know you promised
you&#8217;d tell stories. You will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Deborah&#8217;s gray eyes swept the circle of interested
faces raised to her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course I will, Virginia,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Where shall I begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the very beginning,&#8221; suggested Carver and
Jack together. &#8220;We want it all, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad William put marigolds on the table,&#8221;
Aunt Deborah began. &#8220;They make it easy for me
to get started. They take me back fifty years ago
to the day before I was married back in Iowa.
Robert came up that evening, and saw me with a
brown dress on and marigolds at my waist. &#8216;Wear
them to-morrow, Deborah,&#8217; says he. &#8216;They&#8217;re so
bright and sunny and a good omen. You see, <i>we&#8217;re</i>
going to need sunshine on our wedding journey.&#8217;
So the next day, when I was married, I wore some
marigolds against my white dress. Some folks
thought &#8217;twas an awful queer thing to do. They
said roses would have been much more <i>weddingy</i>,
but Robert and I knew&mdash;and it didn&#8217;t matter about
other folks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The very next day we started for our new home
across the plains. That was to be our wedding journey.
&#8217;Twas in July, 1864. We went to Council
Bluffs to meet the others of our train. That was
just a small town then. In about three days they&#8217;d
all collected together, ready to start. We didn&#8217;t
have so large a party as some. There were about
seventy-five wagons in all, and two hundred persons,
counting the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget how I felt when I saw the last
house go out of sight. I was sitting in the back
of our wagon&mdash;we were near the end of the train
that day&mdash;and Robert was ahead driving the oxen.
But I guess he knew how I was feeling, for he came
back and comforted me. There was comfort, too,
in the way other folks besides me were feeling.
There wasn&#8217;t many dry eyes on the day we swung
into the plains, and yet we wouldn&#8217;t have turned
back&mdash;no, not for worlds!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Deborah paused now and then for the
eager questions which her interested listeners
asked. Yes, she told them, the wagons were
great, white-covered prairie schooners&mdash;real houses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
on wheels. Yes, the oxen were powerfully
slow, but good, kind beasts. No, they were not
all. There were mules in the train and a few
horses. Most of those were ridden by scouts&mdash;men
who received their food and bed for giving
protection against the Indians. Yes, there were
small children and tiny babies&mdash;whole families seeking
new homes in this great land. Two babies were
born on the journey. One lived to reach Montana
and to grow into a strong, stout man; the other, a
little girl, died on the way, and was buried somewhere
in Nebraska.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there were many hard things like that,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;but we expected sadness and trouble and sorrow
when we started out. We were not the first
who had crossed the plains. There were pleasures,
too. Nights when we stopped to camp there was a
whole village of us. The men placed the wagons in
a great circle, and within the circle was our fire
and supper. We forgot to be lonely when the stars
came out and looked down upon us&mdash;the only human
things for miles around. We told stories and
visited one another&#8217;s wagons, and were thankful to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
be together. Friends were made then&mdash;real friends
that always stuck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indians?&#8221; she asked in response to Jack&#8217;s interested
questions. &#8220;Oh, yes, we found plenty of those
to our sorrow! The first real hostile ones we met
in Nebraska, six weeks after we started. Two days
before they came I&#8217;d somehow felt as though we
were having too smooth sailing for pioneers. One
morning four of our men took horses and rode out
searching for water. We never saw three of them
again. At noon the only one left came riding up,
half-dead from exhaustion and from wounds which
the Indians had given him. He gave the alarm and
soon we were ready for them, our wagons in a circle,
and every man armed. Some women, too.&#8221;
Aunt Deborah&#8217;s head rose proudly. &#8220;I shot my first
shot that day, and I killed an Indian. Robert was
proud of me that night!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the journey went on, she told them. The long,
hot days of mid-summer on the plains shortened into
the cooler ones of September and October. All were
wearying, of course, but few actually dangerous.
The attacks from Indians were rare. They seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
to have learned that more could be gained by friendly
bartering. By October the train had left the plains
and was going higher into the mountains. The air
grew more exhilarating. There was less sickness
in the village on wheels. One October morning they
found a light covering of snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how that snow made me feel,&#8221;
said Aunt Deborah. &#8220;It made me afraid somehow.
I thought of the days I must stay alone that coming
winter while Robert was away. But my fears
went later in the day when the sun once more made
the land like summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was early November when we reached our
journey&#8217;s end in a Montana valley. A few sod huts
were there to welcome us, and the day after our
arrival other pioneers drifted in from the south.
The spot was chosen because it was near water, and
because there seemed to be plenty of wild game.
Some of our train pushed on to the gold mines, another
day&#8217;s journey and more, but it was the gravel
beds of the creek where we were promised gold, and
we decided to stay in the valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built a sod hut like those around us, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
began to get settled. Our poor cows and horses
were glad enough to rest and crop the grass in among
the sagebrush. It was a forlorn-looking village
enough when all our huts were done. I wish you
could have seen it! There we spent our first winter&mdash;the
happiest one of my whole life. Yes, my
dears,&#8221; she said, looking into their doubtful, surprised
faces, &#8220;it <i>was</i> the happiest. There were dangers,
of course, and all kinds of hardships, but those
made no difference. Of course there were lonely
days when I longed for home. When Robert was
there, I didn&#8217;t mind the smoky, crowded hut, but
on the days when he had to be away I felt as though
I couldn&#8217;t stand it much longer. We lived on meat
and milk that winter. The flour gave out and there
was no way to get more, so we had no bread. All
the provisions had been used before February came,
and we could get no more before spring. Buffalo
meat and elk, we ate mostly. Yes, Virginia, what
is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The story, Aunt Deborah, about the Indian coming
into the hut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Aunt Deborah, &#8220;Virginia always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
must have that. It happened on one day that Robert
was away. He had ridden to the mining camp
to try to get flour. I was all alone in the hut. There
had been no news of Indians around, so imagine
my surprise when the door was pushed open and
an Indian walked in. I knew by his signs that he
wanted food, so I gave him all I had. He drank
all the milk in the hut, and some oat cakes which
I had made from our last bit of oat-meal. I remember
how angry I was, for I had been saving
them especially for Robert, but I dared not refuse.
Then he began admiring a rug which we had brought
from home. It was on the bed in the corner. He
asked me for it, and I refused. Then he insisted,
and I still refused. But he wanted that rug, and
was going to have it. At last he just grabbed it,
and made for the door. That was too much for
me. My grandmother had given Robert and me
that rug for a wedding gift, and no Indian was going
to take it away. I snatched Robert&#8217;s gun from
the corner and raised it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Drop it, or I shoot you!&#8221; I screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he knew I meant what I said, for he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
dropped the rug and hurried out of the cabin. I
don&#8217;t know how long I sat there facing the door.
I was afraid he would bring others back, but he
never came again. When Robert came that night,
I was still facing the door with the gun. When I
saw him, I burst out crying, and cried and cried.
The strain had been too much for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Aunt Deborah&#8217;s stories went on&mdash;of the village
attacked by night, and her fearful ride to
the little fort for protection; of the Vigilantes and
their determined hunting-down of robbers and road-agents;
of a sickness which broke out in the town
toward spring; of hunger and privations&mdash;the varied,
fascinating, almost incredible tales of pioneer
life. Then, like oases, would come stories of Christmas
festivities, and of merry, laughing times all
together. The minutes, half-hours, and hours flew
by as they listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Thought Book will never hold them all,&#8221;
Priscilla whispered to Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the spring,&#8221; Aunt Deborah finished, casting
an anxious glance at the sun, &#8220;all was different.
A trail to Salt Lake had been opened and provisions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
came through by stage. I&#8217;ll never forget the
morning the first stage train came. Men had use
for their money then, though many of them used
gold weighed out in little scales. Flour was a dollar
and a half a pound, calico fifty cents a yard,
and eggs five dollars a dozen. Shoes were priceless.
One man bought a pair for thirty dollars. I
remember that Robert and I wanted to give our
neighbor&#8217;s little girl a birthday present. After
much thought we decided on an apple, and paid a
dollar for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you did it,&#8221; said Vivian, who
had not spoken a word since Aunt Deborah began.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe girls of to-day could live through
such terrible things!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they could, dear,&#8221; affirmed Aunt Deborah,
&#8220;only the need hasn&#8217;t come. When it does, you&#8217;ll
all be ready. Of course, the Pioneer Days are over,
but there is always need of pioneers&mdash;for Vigilantes,
like yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>A half hour later and Aunt Deborah was again
in the wagon beside Alec&mdash;again very straight and
very stiff. She had had a beautiful day, she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
smiling upon them all. She had gathered thoughts
and memories enough for another year.</p>
<p>William came up to the carriage just as Alec
lifted the reins. His hands were filled with marigolds&mdash;brown
and orange and yellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you might like &#8217;em, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said
shyly.</p>
<p>A light came into Aunt Deborah&#8217;s gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like them, William!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Like them!
They&#8217;ll give me even more memories&mdash;the very
sweetest of my life.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>MR. CRUSOE OF CRIPPLE CREEK</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Crusoe was washing an extra shirt in the
ford between Elk Creek Valley and the Gap. The
absence of soap was a distinct disadvantage, but
water, a corrugated stone, and Mr. Crusoe&#8217;s diligence
were working wonders. A short distance
away among the quaking-asps smoldered the embers
of a small fire; a blackened and empty bean-can
on the hearth-stone, together with a two-tined
fork, bore evidence of a recent breakfast.</p>
<p>His washing completed, Mr. Crusoe turned his
attention to his personal appearance. Deep in the
waters of Elk Creek he plunged his arms, bare to
the elbow, and washed his neck and face. From one
pocket he drew a soiled and folded towel, which
upon being unrolled disclosed a diminutive brush
and an almost toothless comb. With these he proceeded
to arrange his somewhat long and dripping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
black hair. His two weeks&#8217; old whiskers apparently
worried him, for he pulled them meditatively; but
since he was far from a barber and carried no shaving
appliances, the brush and comb must suffice for
them also. Finally he took his battered old hat from
a nearby branch, brushed it carefully, arranged the
crown so that fewer holes appeared, and put it
upon his head. His clean shirt, spread upon a quaking-asp
but by no means dry, afforded the best of
reasons why he should not hurry; so, drawing a
stained and stubby pipe and sack of tobacco from
another pocket, Mr. Crusoe lay beneath a friendly
cottonwood at the water&#8217;s edge and gave himself
to quiet contemplation.</p>
<p>The morning was perfect, and no one could appreciate
it more keenly than Mr. Crusoe, wanderer
that he was. He blew a great mouthful of blue
smoke into the still air, watched it circle lazily
upward, and blew another to hasten the progress
of the first. His black eyes, peering from a forest
of eyebrows and whiskers, looked long upon the
blossoms that clothed Elk Creek Valley&mdash;sunflowers,
early golden-rod and purple thistles&mdash;swept the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
friendly, tumbling foot-hills and sought beneath the
over-hanging trees for the secrets of the creek. It
was a morning to love things, Mr. Crusoe thought
to himself. He was glad that he had left his comrades
of the railroad tracks; more glad that he
had abandoned freight-jumping for a season; most
glad that he had decided to work during the early
fall months. Then with money in his pockets and
a new suit of clothes upon his back, he might go
back to Cripple Creek whence he had come.</p>
<p>A few minutes later his contemplations were
broken by the sound of horses&#8217; feet coming through
the Gap. He sat up, interested, and removed his
pipe. In another moment as he met the wide-open
eyes of two very much startled young ladies, his hat
followed. Mr. Crusoe was used to speaking to persons
whom he met in his journeyings. It was one
of the many joys of the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-mornin&#8217;, comrades,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The hearts of Mary and Vivian leaped into their
throats. Their eyes, leaving Mr. Crusoe&#8217;s, saw in
one terrifying instant the shirt drying on the quaking-asp,
the smoldering fire, the empty bean-can.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
This man was a tramp! He belonged to that disgusting
clan of vagabonds who asked for food at
back-doors, and whom one, if frightened into doing
it, fed on back stoops as one fed the cat! He, like
his fellows, would inspire one to lock all the doors
at noonday, and to tell one&#8217;s neighbors there was
a tramp abroad!</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-mornin&#8217;,&#8221; said Mr. Crusoe again. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a fine day.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time Mary answered. She did not dare keep
silent. The tramp might become angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>Vivian said nothing. She was waiting for Mary
to plan a means of escape. Meanwhile Siwash and
his companion, feeling their reins tighten, had
stopped and were nibbling at the quaking-asps, quite
undisturbed.</p>
<p>Mr. Crusoe rose, hat in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was you plannin&#8217; to ford, young ladies?&#8221; he
asked politely.</p>
<p>The vanishing flanks of two horses, unceremoniously
yanked away from their luncheon and turned
toward the prairie, were his only answer. Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Crusoe gazed wonderingly into a cloud of dust.
Then he felt of his washing on the quaking-asp.
It was dry enough. Laying his pipe and hat
on the ground, he proceeded to get into the clean
shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little things!&#8221; he said from its somewhat
damp depths. &#8220;They was plum scared of me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The shirt on, he did its mate into a bundle, cut
a forked stick upon which to sling it, stamped out
the last ember of his dying fire, took his hat and
pipe, and started north up the creek trail.</p>
<p>Vivian and Mary did not stop their wild gallop
until they were well in sight of the nearest house
on the prairie. Blue gentians for Miss Wallace,
which had been their errand, were quite forgotten.
So also was the glory of the morning. Instead,
there ever rose before their still startled eyes a
black-whiskered, coatless man, smoking the stub
of a dirty pipe beneath a cottonwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary,&#8221; said Vivian, gathering courage as the
Keith house came into view, and breaking a long,
frightened silence, &#8220;Mary, did you ever see any
one so villainous-looking in your life&mdash;outside of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
movies, I mean? I guess my heart will never stop
thumping! I wish Virginia had been with us! She&#8217;s
always saying there&#8217;s no one around here to harm
any one. I just wish she had!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sort of wish we hadn&#8217;t run so,&#8221; returned Mary,
pulling her horse down to a walk. &#8220;Maybe he wasn&#8217;t
any one harmful at all, only he scared me so I never
stopped to think. I&#8217;d hate to be a snob, even to
a tramp!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t! I glory in it! And, besides, you
needn&#8217;t worry. It takes time to be a snob, and we
didn&#8217;t waste a moment. Here&#8217;s the Keith house.
Hadn&#8217;t we best go in for a moment? There&#8217;s Carver
now playing with Kenneth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Keiths, upon hearing the story, quieted
Vivian&#8217;s fears, and confirmed Mary&#8217;s increasing regret.
The man was only a hobo, Donald said, doubtless
seeking work. They looked unmistakably
rough, but were often good fellows inside.
Probably he wouldn&#8217;t have frightened them for the
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish this fellow would stray our way,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be in need of extra hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
when threshing comes, and it won&#8217;t be long now.
Dad would welcome him all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian stared at Donald, incredulous and speechless.
There was no need of asking him if he meant
what he had just said. Apparently that horrible
creature back there by the creek, the very remembrance
of whom caused cold shivers to run over
Vivian, would be given a welcome by the Keith family.
Vivian&#8217;s nose, already a trifle high, rose higher.
Democracy was unquestionably a splendid attribute.
Since knowing Virginia and coming West, she was
more inclined to believe in it than ever. But this
was too much!</p>
<p>An hour later they were riding homeward, their
hands filled with gentians. Donald and Jack had
ridden back with them to the ford to act as protectors,
and, Vivian secretly believed, to interview
the hobo, were he still there, upon the subject of
threshing. But only an empty bean-can and the
charred remnants of a fire bore evidence of the
wayfarer. He had gone! Reassured, they had gathered
gentians to their hearts&#8217; content, left the boys
upon the prairie, and ridden homeward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>Mr. Hunter came to meet them as they rode beneath
the cottonwoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crusoe,&#8221; he called to some one on the other side
of the porch, &#8220;here&#8217;s your first job! Take these
horses to the corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>An attempt to describe the sensations which swept
over Mary and Vivian when they recognized their
acquaintance of the morning would be impossible.
Unable for a moment to dismount, they sat in their
saddles and stared. Mr. Crusoe, undoubtedly sensible
of their surprise, patted Siwash, who responded
gladly in spite of black whiskers and a battered
hat. Mr. Hunter, thinking that the flowers might
be the reason of their delay, relieved them of the
gentians. Mary and Vivian, thus assisted, finally
fell from the saddles, and followed Mr. Hunter to
the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hunter,&#8221; gasped Vivian when the new man
had taken the horses, &#8220;do you know who he is?
He&#8217;s a hobo! Donald said so! We met him this
morning down at the ford&mdash;Mary and I. He scared
us almost to death! He had washed a shirt and
it was drying on the bushes, and he ate canned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
beans for breakfast right out of the can with a
dirty, bent, old fork. He was lying under a tree
and smoking a hideous pipe as we rode up! I
never was so horrified in all my life! And, Mr.
Hunter, he took off his hat and spoke to us! I
thought we&#8217;d die! Siwash would eat the bushes, and
I thought we&#8217;d never escape! He&#8217;s not going to
stay here after he has something to eat, is he,
Mr. Hunter? You don&#8217;t know how awful he
is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian stopped&mdash;merely for breath. Mr. Hunter
with a mighty effort repressed a smile. Mary was
torn between a desire to play fair and the awful
remembrance of her fright. She said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vivian,&#8221; said Mr. Hunter, &#8220;out here we&#8217;ve
learned not to judge persons by whether or not they
wash in the creek and eat canned beans. I&#8217;m sorry
Crusoe frightened you. He isn&#8217;t exactly captivating
in appearance, I&#8217;ll admit, but, from what I can
gather, he seems to be a pretty good sort. Any
man&#8217;s worth a try-out, you know. He&#8217;s looking
for work, and now that threshing is coming on
I&#8217;m looking for an extra man, so he&#8217;s going to stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
here a spell. These fellows who take to the road,
you see, fill a great need out here in this country.
We depend on one or more of them showing up
about this time of year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian was still staring, unable to speak. Mary,
desirous that Mr. Crusoe should not misunderstand
their flight, explained the affair to Mr. Hunter, a
little more rationally than Vivian had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she finished, &#8220;it&#8217;s just that we aren&#8217;t
used to seeing persons like that, and he <i>did</i> look
fierce, Mr. Hunter. I wish you&#8217;d explain to him
how it was. I shouldn&#8217;t want to be rude even to
a hobo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll understand, Mary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In fact, he
does already, for when he saw you riding home
he told me about how frightened you were at the
ford. Don&#8217;t be at all alarmed, Vivian,&#8221; he called,
for Vivian was hurrying into the house, her head
high. &#8220;He&#8217;s a gentleman&mdash;underneath the whiskers
and the shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Mr. Crusoe stayed on at the Hunter ranch.
The men liked him&mdash;that was plain to be seen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
Every evening their laughter echoed from the bunk-house
where Mr. Crusoe was entertaining them with
his songs and stories. Even the silent William was
loud in his praise, and Mr. Weeks, the foreman, in
speaking of his ability and readiness to work, suggested
a permanent position. Mary allowed but a
day to go by before apologizing for her flight from
the ford, and after Mr. Crusoe&#8217;s courteous acceptance
became his firm adherent, much to Vivian&#8217;s
disgust. Even Aunt Nan found him interesting,
while Virginia and Priscilla listened eagerly to his
tales of Cripple Creek. They were collecting theme
material, they told the disdainful Vivian.</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Crusoe had stormed and taken
the Hunter ranch. Only one member of the family
remained his enemy. Vivian was still unconvinced.
To her every one else on the ranch had taken his
place among the number of those condemned by
the apostle, &#8220;who, having eyes, see not.&#8221; In her
suspicious eyes Mr. Crusoe was a &#8220;ravening wolf&#8221;
of whom she should beware. When she had an
infrequent occasion to address him she used an offended
dignity, tinged with scorn; when his name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
was brought into the conversation she remained
silent, secure in the knowledge that some day they
would all see this tramp in his true light!</p>
<p>In three days Vivian had worked herself into
a state from the eminence of which she looked down
with protecting pity upon Aunt Nan, the other Vigilantes,
and Mr. Hunter. They were being hoodwinked,
and she alone was left to guard their interests.
Harrowing memories of tales she had read,
terrifying visions of escaped criminals whom she
had witnessed in the &#8220;movies,&#8221; and who exactly
resembled Mr. Crusoe, came to disturb her rest and
haunt her dreams. She was a quaking detective,
watching Mr. Crusoe&#8217;s every act, and discovering
treachery and evil design in the most innocent of
them.</p>
<p>On the fourth day following Mr. Crusoe&#8217;s advent
matters approached a climax. In the early
afternoon Mr. Hunter, driving to town on business,
had taken the other Vigilantes with him. Vivian,
with letters to write, had remained at home, feeling
safe with Aunt Nan. In her stimulated imagination
Mr. Crusoe had been behaving peculiarly all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
the morning, and not for worlds would she have
stayed alone.</p>
<p>Hannah left soon after the others, going for raspberries
up the canyon; Aunt Nan, thoughtful and
strangely silent, was in the living-room, where
within an hour she was joined by Malcolm Keith;
Vivian sat beneath the vines in the corner of the
porch, and tried to center her attention upon a letter
she was writing to Dorothy. She was not eminently
successful. Grave apprehensions, strange
forebodings, filled her heart. Once Mr. Crusoe
passed empty-handed before the porch. He did not
see Vivian, although he might easily have detected
the beating of her heart. She watched him pause,
study for a brief moment the house, its doors and
windows, and then pass on. He was seizing the
opportunity while they were all away, Vivian told
herself, to become better acquainted with his surroundings.
Then some day, not far distant, or
some night, he&mdash;&mdash;!</p>
<p>She jumped from her seat and ran indoors. At
that moment she wanted company more than anything
else in the world. Sunny as it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
outside, the silence worried her. There was something
portentous even in the singing of the August insects.
Aunt Nan&#8217;s genuine interest in Mr. Crusoe
and his welfare would probably prevent Vivian from
giving expression to her new-born fears; but at
least nearness to some one might quiet the misgivings
which were tormenting her.</p>
<p>She reached the living-room door, and stood still,
unable to make her presence known, and, for a
moment, unable to run away. Aunt Nan and
Malcolm Keith were standing by the big western
window which faced the prairie and the distant
mountains. Malcolm&#8217;s arm was around Aunt Nan,
and her head was on his shoulder. As Vivian stood
transfixed to the spot by a strange Something,
Malcolm bent his head, and&mdash;Vivian fled, unperceived!</p>
<p>That same strange Something, stronger than her
fear of the silence or even of Mr. Crusoe, was
making her breath come in gasps as she sank into
her chair and tried to collect her scattered senses.
Truly Life was being too generous to her that day!
So Malcolm and Aunt Nan loved each other! That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
was clearly unmistakable. She was sorry she had
intruded, though she knew they had not heard her.
In that last moment before she had found strength
to run away she felt as though she had come unbidden
into a sacred place. Her cheeks burned at
the thought. How surprised the girls would be
when she told them! No, she would not tell! It
was Aunt Nan&#8217;s secret&mdash;hers and Malcolm&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, still unperceived and to
all appearances quite forgotten, she sat in her chair
and watched Aunt Nan and Malcolm go down the lane
beneath the cottonwoods, and on toward the foot-hills.
They had forgotten her very existence. She
was all alone&mdash;alone with Mr. Crusoe and the silence.
At that very instant Mr. Crusoe again passed
before the porch&mdash;again paused to study the house.
This time he held a key in his hand&mdash;a large key on
a string which he twisted and untwisted as it swung
from his big, brown finger. Vivian knew that key.
It belonged to the root-cellar just beyond the kitchen,
and it hung in Mr. Hunter&#8217;s office above his desk.
She had seen Hannah take it a dozen times, and
once Mr. Hunter had given it to Virginia, asking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
her to get some papers from a desk he kept down
there. Why should Mr. Crusoe want to go to the
root-cellar?</p>
<p>Something told Vivian that the time for her to
act had come; that only she could save the Hunter
fortunes from oncoming disaster. As Mr. Crusoe
rounded the farther corner of the porch, and started
in the direction of the root-cellar, Vivian ran
through the house and into Hannah&#8217;s spotless
kitchen. A new sense of responsibility gave birth
to a bran-new sense of courage. Vivian, watching
from the kitchen window, saw Mr. Crusoe go into
the cellar. That was enough.</p>
<p>Running to Virginia&#8217;s room, she grasped the little
rifle which stood in the corner. It was the only
gun in the house which Vivian had ever used, and
her one experience with it had not given her a far-reaching
knowledge of fire-arms. Still, it was a
gun, and guns concealed cowardice, and lent power
and dignity to one&#8217;s bearing. Vivian knew that it
was loaded. Virginia always kept it ready in case
a gopher poked his inquisitive little nose above the
ground. She knew, too, that a quick push of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
thumb would drive back the safety and leave the
gun ready to shoot.</p>
<p>She ran down the hall and out the back door toward
the root cellar. Her heart was in her mouth,
her breath came in gasps, her wide-open blue eyes
were filled with terror. When she reached the stone
steps leading down to the cellar she looked far less
a heroine than a much frightened little girl. Still,
there was the gun! Vivian&#8217;s nervous fingers kept
pushing the safety on and off&mdash;a rather terrifying
sound to the ears of a much surprised man, who, papers
in hand, was coming up the steps.</p>
<p>Vivian saw the papers. She was right! Mr. Crusoe
had been rifling Mr. Hunter&#8217;s private possessions.
She raised the gun with a trembling hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Crusoe,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;this gun is loaded,
and if you try to pass me, I&mdash;I&#8217;m very sure I shall
shoot you. You sit down there in the cellar and
wait for Mr. Hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Crusoe sat down. He was too surprised to
do anything else. He had faced guns many times
before in his varied existence, but never had he been
confronted by a shaking .22 in the trembling hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
of a very nervous young lady. Moreover, the sound
of a safety clicking nervously back and forth is not
conducive to peace. Mr. Crusoe did not expect
Vivian to shoot him, but he did entertain a fear
that the gun might go off in his direction and in
spite of her. Considering silence the better part of
valor, he accordingly sought the farthest corner of
the cellar and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>Vivian sat upon the top step, the gun upon her
knees. She had not looked for such non-resistance
on the part of Mr. Crusoe. Indeed, he looked less
fierce than she had ever seen him. Could she have
observed the amused smile which was quivering beneath
Mr. Crusoe&#8217;s black whiskers as he began more
fully to understand this peculiar situation, she would
have been much puzzled. To her, he was a cringing
suppliant, and she a distinct conqueror.</p>
<p>Still the minutes dragged themselves very slowly
away. It seemed two hours, though it was in reality
but ten minutes before conqueror and conquered
heard the roll of returning wheels, the sound
of voices calling for Vivian, the approach of hurrying
footsteps. Mr. Crusoe stirred uneasily. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
would have willingly saved Vivian from the embarrassment
which he knew was bound to follow, but
it had been impossible. Vivian&#8217;s heart beat wildly.
Now, at least, they would understand that she had
been right all along; now, perhaps, they would no
longer think her such a coward!</p>
<p>Embarrassment did follow! Embarrassment and
tears and explanations and not a little ill-concealed
amusement. For one long hour Vivian, in spite
of sympathy and understanding and genuine admiration,
wished she had never been born. In that
hour she discovered that a finer courage is necessary
to admit a mistake and to begin anew than to
besiege a hobo in a root-cellar. But she proved
equal to the task, and Mr. Crusoe in the part he
played showed himself the gentleman he really was.
For when Vivian was convinced that Mr. Crusoe had
been given the key by Mr. Hunter, that he had
been told to fetch the papers, and that he really
was trustworthy after all, she dried her tears, donned
a fresh middy, and went quite alone to offer her
apologies.</p>
<p>She found Mr. Crusoe by the bunk-house. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
had shaved in the meantime, and when Vivian saw
his clean firm chin, she knew it was partly the whiskers
which had made her level the gun at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Crusoe,&#8221; she stammered. &#8220;You
see, I thought you were just a tramp, and at home
we are always afraid of them. But I know now
you aren&#8217;t. I know I&#8217;ve been wrong all the time,
and&mdash;oh, I&#8217;m awfully glad the gun didn&#8217;t go off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Crusoe removed his battered old hat and
offered his freshly-washed hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, too, Miss Vivian,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If it
had, perhaps I couldn&#8217;t have told you how much
pluck I think you&#8217;ve got stored away inside of you.
And as for your being suspicious of the likes o&#8217;
me, I don&#8217;t wonder a mite. Only, you see, there are
tramps and tramps. To the best of us, I guess
trampin&#8217; just means followin&#8217; roads that lead to
shelters&mdash;to <i>homes</i>, you see! And now you know
I&#8217;m not the kind you thought I was, this here ranch
looks like a mighty good home to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t go back to Cripple Creek?&#8221;
asked Vivian. &#8220;If I were you I&#8217;d stay right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m plannin&#8217; on,&#8221; said Mr. Crusoe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A LETTER FROM DOROTHY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It seems an age, doesn&#8217;t it, since we&#8217;ve had a
real meeting,&#8221; said the founder of the Vigilantes,
&#8220;and yet it&#8217;s only nine weeks ago this very identical
day. I guess it&#8217;s because the places are so far
apart and so different. The last time &#8217;twas on the
big rock back of the Retreat, and now it&#8217;s away
out here in the Land of our Dreams. Oh, you&#8217;ll
never, never know what it&#8217;s meaning to me to have
you all out here, because it&#8217;s one of the things you
feel inside but can never, never tell!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we know,&#8221; cried Priscilla, &#8220;because we&#8217;re
feeling it, too! Every day I think I&#8217;ll die if I get
any happier, but I guess happiness is one of the
things you can keep pouring into your heart like
love&mdash;without its overflowing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the very same way about pouring it out, too,&#8221;
said Mary. &#8220;There&#8217;s always plenty left like the
oil in the Bible story.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the mountains way off there blue?&#8221; cried
Vivian. &#8220;I think blue&#8217;s the happiest color in the
world. I&#8217;ll never say that I feel <i>blue</i> again now
that I&#8217;ve seen the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had climbed to the summit of Spruce Ridge
for their Vigilante meeting&mdash;the first formal one
they had held since their arrival in Virginia&#8217;s country.
A letter from Dorothy, coming an hour ago,
bore the inscription, &#8220;To be read at a Vigilante
meeting,&#8221; and in order to be honest to the letter, as
well as in spirit, they had decided upon a place apart
and assembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, it&#8217;s better to come away like this,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Virginia. &#8220;There&#8217;s a queer, common
feeling that doesn&#8217;t come when we just sit on
the porch and talk. And I love this sweep of country
from the Ridge. It&#8217;s real Vigilante land.
Now let&#8217;s have the letter, Priscilla. I&#8217;m wild
to hear it. It&#8217;s the very first we&#8217;ve had in a
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>The secretary of the order broke a large amount
of sealing-wax, unfolded sheets of blue stationery,
and began:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Piece of Heaven in California</span>,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aug. 11,19&mdash;.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Fellow Vigilantes</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve been trying desperately to write you for
weeks and weeks, but you&#8217;ve no idea what the
cares of a household are, especially when you have
a child around.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;A child!&#8221; cried all the Vigilantes at once. &#8220;What
child?&#8221;</p>
<p>Priscilla continued:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But before I tell you about <i>Virginia Winthrop
Richards</i>, I must say that the summer is
being even more wonderful than Dad and I ever
dreamed. I never got so well-acquainted with my
own father in all my life, and he&#8217;s been a perfect
darling to devote days and days to me. The
bungalow is more heavenly than ever. It&#8217;s positively
buried in roses and heliotrope, and you&#8217;d
never know it had a chimney. You&#8217;d think that
a huge geranium was growing right out of the
roof. The front porch looks out upon the sea.
Oh, it&#8217;s such a dark, deep, sparkly blue! And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
when the sky is blue, too, and the sand is golden,
and the white gulls skim next the water&mdash;nothing
could be more beautiful in all the world! I
think of you a hundred times a day, and wish
that you were here. So does Dad. I&#8217;ve told him
all about the Vigilantes, and he&#8217;s so interested.
He says he&#8217;s thankful every day that I have such
fine friends at St. Helen&#8217;s. In fact, I just know
he&#8217;s more pleased with me than ever before. I
think he sees there&#8217;s hope ahead, and it&#8217;s a very
comforting assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now I must tell you about Virginia Winthrop
Richards. I know you&#8217;re consumed with
curiosity. If you could see her, you&#8217;d be consumed
with envy. She is seven years old and
all pink and white and blue and gold. Her cheeks
are just the color of wild roses, and her eyes
deep blue&mdash;almost like the water&mdash;and her hair
golden brown with lights in it. I dress her in
pink or blue or white all the time. One day
two weeks ago Dad and I went to Los Angeles
to buy clothes for her. I don&#8217;t believe I ever
had quite such a good time in all my life. &#8217;Twas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
just like shopping for one&#8217;s very own child. I
put my hair up high for the occasion, and endeavored
to look matronly, but I guess I failed,
for when I saw a ravishing pink dress and said,
&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s too small for my little girl,&#8221; the
stupid clerk laughed in my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We bought the sweetest things you ever saw!
Hair-ribbons and adorable shoes and socks striped
like sticks of candy and little fairy night-dresses
all trimmed in lace. Then Dad bought some
toys. I let him do that. He bought a doll and
books and a cart and horses, for we want Virginia
to be a trifle boyish, too, you see. While
he was doing it, his eyes just beamed and beamed.
He said he felt just as he did when I was little
and he bought toys for me. When we reached
home and showed the things to Virginia Winthrop
Richards, I thought she&#8217;d die of happiness.
Really, I didn&#8217;t know but that we&#8217;d lose her
after all!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But here I am dressing my child for you, and
you don&#8217;t even know who she is! She wasn&#8217;t
anybody but <i>Minnie</i> and <i>No. 31</i> until three weeks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
ago. I&#8217;ve always thought it would be a heavy
cross enough to be named <i>Minnie</i> anyway, even
though you had a respectable surname, but to be
<i>Minnie</i> without any surname at all, and <i>No. 31</i>
in addition, seem to me the depths of misery. We
found her in the Home for Friendless Children,
and I&#8217;ll always believe that an angel led us there!
Dad and I went to the city three weeks ago this
very Sunday and walked by the Home. We didn&#8217;t
even know &#8217;twas there&mdash;just stumbled upon it
while we were roaming around in search of adventure.
Poor little <i>31</i> was sitting under a tree
on the lawn holding a shingle and singing to it.
I&#8217;ll never forget how she looked. Her curls were
braided up tight, and tied with a shoe-string, and
she was dressed in a hideous blue-checked thing,
but even those drawbacks couldn&#8217;t spoil her. Dad
and I just stopped and stared, and then we walked
up the steps and in at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Whose child is that out there on the lawn?&#8221;
Dad asked the matron who greeted us at the office
entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She was a tall, stern-looking person in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
shirtwaist and a high, starched collar. You just
couldn&#8217;t imagine her holding a baby, or one cuddling
up against her neck. She said <i>No. 31</i> was
nobody&#8217;s child. She had been left in an old basket
on the steps six years ago. You see, she isn&#8217;t
one of those children you read about with beautifully
embroidered clothes and gold lockets and
one thousand dollars in bills under her pillow.
She didn&#8217;t have any name or notes or requests for
whoever took her to call at the bank for a fortune
when she was twenty-one. She was just
wrapped in an old blanket and left there. But
Dad and I don&#8217;t care!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;When the matron saw that we were interested,
she asked if we didn&#8217;t want to borrow
<i>No. 31</i> for a few days. She said they sometimes
lent children for two weeks or so. When she
said it, she sounded just as though a child were
a typewriter or a vacuum cleaner, sent on ten days&#8217;
free trial. I looked at Dad and Dad looked at
me, and then he said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll take her!&#8221; It didn&#8217;t
take long for the matron to do up her few clothes
and to get her ready. She was so glad to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
the loan that she hurried. Little No. 31 was so
surprised that she didn&#8217;t know whether to be happy
or not. Perhaps she didn&#8217;t understand what it
was to be really happy, but she knows now!
She&#8217;s positively radiant!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can&#8217;t explain how it seemed when we
brought her home. Somehow &#8217;twas as though
we&#8217;d just begun to be a <i>real</i> family. She snuggled
between Dad and me on the front seat of
the car, and kept looking from one to the other
of us. I think it was her name that first gave us
the idea of keeping her. We couldn&#8217;t call that
adorable child <i>No. 31</i>, and we wouldn&#8217;t call her
<i>Minnie</i>. Of course we couldn&#8217;t name a borrowed
child, and so after I&#8217;d given her a bath, and we&#8217;d
seen how truly sweet and adorable she was, we
decided that at all events she should never, never
go back to that Home, which is a satire on the
word. At first Dad thought he knew of a fine
home for her with some friends of his who
haven&#8217;t any children, but after the ten days&#8217; free
trial were over we knew we just couldn&#8217;t give her
up. Best of all, Mrs. Shute, the housekeeper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
who&#8217;s been with us all summer, loves her to
death, and she&#8217;s promised to stay right on with
Dad, and keep house for him next winter in Los
Angeles. So you see Dad has a home and another
child, and he&#8217;s the happiest man in California.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He let me do the naming, and, of course, I
consulted my child. I couldn&#8217;t think of anything
lovelier than to name her for the two founders
of the Vigilantes, and after I&#8217;d told her all about
you she was pleased as pleased could be. I let
her choose between <i>Priscilla Hunter Richards</i> and
<i>Virginia Winthrop Richards</i>, and she took Virginia
and named her new doll <i>Priscilla</i>. I wish
I could have named her for you and Mary, Vivian,
dear, but Dad thought two names were enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;re the very happiest family you ever saw.
Virginia fits in better every day. She&#8217;s learning
such sweet manners&mdash;I tell Dad it just shows she
must be sweet inside! She&#8217;s learning to read and
to write, too. We have a lesson every morning
after breakfast. The other day I bought the
pattern of a little dress, and Mrs. Shute helped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
me cut it out and make it. I never felt so proud
in all my life. I&#8217;m obliged to be more <i>vigilant</i>
than ever, because Virginia does and says everything
that I do. The other day I said I should
certainly die if I didn&#8217;t get a letter from some
of you, and she was quite frightened. So I guess
I&#8217;ll have to be more moderate in speech after
this.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s one thing more I must tell you before
I stop. I saw Imogene the other day. Dad
and Virginia and I were walking by one of the
big hotels here, when an automobile came up to
the curbing. You can just imagine how surprised
I was when Imogene and Mrs. Meredith stepped
out. There was a young man with them whom
I didn&#8217;t like very well. He had a queer way of
looking at you, and was over-dressed, I thought.
Imogene looked very handsome, and, oh, loads
older! I felt a perfect baby beside her! Mrs.
Meredith was just the same, only even more elaborately
gowned than she used to be when she visited
Imogene. Imogene was as surprised as I
was, I think, though she didn&#8217;t show it. She and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
her mother shook hands with me, and she introduced
her friend. I was so excited I didn&#8217;t hear
his name at all. She told me she was going to be
married at Christmas time, and so wouldn&#8217;t be
back at St. Helen&#8217;s, and Mr. Whoever-he-was
laughed and said Imogene had been to school long
enough. Dad and I asked them to tea with us,
but they said they were just hurrying through and
couldn&#8217;t come.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;When they left us and went into the hotel I
had the queerest feeling. &#8217;Twas just as though
I had said good-by to Imogene forever&mdash;just as
though she&#8217;d gone away into a different world.
And the queerest part of it all was that I didn&#8217;t
care very much. It seemed years since I had cared
for her&mdash;years since we had done things together
at St. Helen&#8217;s. That night after I had put Virginia
to bed, and come out on the porch with Dad,
a big machine flew by our house. I heard some
one laugh, and knew it was Imogene. She hadn&#8217;t
been hurrying through; she just hadn&#8217;t cared to
come. I suppose it ought to have hurt me, but
it didn&#8217;t. I was glad she&#8217;d stopped caring, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
the way I had. Then, at least, neither of us would
be hurt. The only thing I&#8217;m sorry about is that
Imogene has gone into that kind of a world. I
don&#8217;t believe it can give the best kind of happiness,
do you?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s nearly church time, and I must hurry.
We&#8217;re all going together. It&#8217;s Virginia&#8217;s very first
service, except for those at the Home, and I do
hope she&#8217;ll be good. I&#8217;ve been instructing her for
days&mdash;telling her just what to do and what not
to do. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll send out many thoughts
in your direction, but Miss Wallace says they&#8217;re
prayers anyway&mdash;that is, the kind I&#8217;d send to you,
so I guess it will be all right. There&#8217;s Virginia
calling now.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:8em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Dearest love,</p>
<p style='margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dorothy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;P.S. After service. She was angelic!
When she knelt and closed her eyes, she looked
like one of Raphael&#8217;s cherubs. Dad wiped his
eyes&mdash;I saw him&mdash;and I could have cried for happiness.
The sermon was on &#8220;Vigilance&#8221;&mdash;wasn&#8217;t
that strange? The minister spoke about watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
for opportunities to serve, for in so doing, he
said, we served ourselves most of all. Dad
looked at me then and smiled, and we both looked
at Virginia, our opportunity. She was finding
<i>A&#8217;s</i> in the prayer-book.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This is a selfish letter&mdash;all about me&mdash;but I
knew you&#8217;d want to know about your namesake.
Write me right away. We&#8217;ll be watching every
mail.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dorothy</span>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>They looked at one another with shining eyes as
Priscilla folded the letter. Mary was the first to
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the loveliest thing in all the world for
Dorothy to do?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; cried the two who possessed a
namesake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we ought to make Virginia Winthrop
Richards a present,&#8221; proposed Priscilla. &#8220;I never
felt so important in all my life, did you, Virginia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; said Virginia. &#8220;Why so quiet, Vivian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking about Imogene,&#8221; said Vivian.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering why I don&#8217;t care much either. It&#8217;s
strange when I cared so much for her&mdash;only four
months ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their excitement over Dorothy&#8217;s child, the others
had for the moment forgotten Imogene.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s because we went as far as the crossroads
together,&#8221; explained Virginia, &#8220;and then chose
different paths. I feel the same way Dorothy does.
I&#8217;m sorry for Imogene, but I don&#8217;t feel any great
loss myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I propose we adjourn,&#8221; said the excited Priscilla,
&#8220;and go down and tell the news to Aunt Nan and
Mr. Hunter. That is, if there&#8217;s no more business,&#8221;
she added, looking toward the president.</p>
<p>The president declared the meeting adjourned,
and they started homeward. By a large spruce they
stopped for a moment. The ground beneath the
tree was a garden, glad with blossoming flowers.
Virginia&#8217;s gray eyes looked at them, then sought
the distant mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;that I&#8217;d love
to come up here the way I do. Of course I know
Jim isn&#8217;t here. He&#8217;s gone on to make others happy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Somewhere Else. But I like to remember how we
used to climb up here and look off at the country.
He always loved it so. I used to be so lonely without
him, but now I&#8217;m glad&mdash;glad he&#8217;s having all the
wonderful things that just must happen after we&mdash;go
on! That&#8217;s why I like William&#8217;s flowers so!
They&#8217;re so glad, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like William for taking such good care of
them,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;I saw him coming up here yesterday
with his garden tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;William!&#8221; cried Virginia gladly. &#8220;Why, William&#8217;s
<i>always</i> been next best to Jim!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;EVER VIGILANT&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason in the world why more than
three of us should go back,&#8221; said Virginia. &#8220;I know
just exactly where she left it. It&#8217;s on the table just
back of the jars of raspberries. All right, Vivian,
if you insist and are sure you&#8217;re not too tired. It&#8217;s
all of six miles there and back, you know. It&#8217;s not
a bit necessary, Carver, but we&#8217;d love to have you
come if you want to. Sagebrush Point, Don&mdash;at the
open place? All right, we&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure to make the Canyon Path before dusk,&#8221;
warned Donald. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad there, you know. Signals
all right? Better take my revolver. Malcolm
has his.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia examined the revolver before securing
the holster to her saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, if we need you; three, if everything&#8217;s all
right. You probably won&#8217;t hear either. We&#8217;ll see
you by six o&#8217;clock. Good luck!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>She turned Pedro, and, followed by Carver and
Vivian, rode back up the trail, while the others
kept on down the mountain side toward Sagebrush
Point where they were to meet Malcolm and Aunt
Nan.</p>
<p>They had ridden far up Bear Canyon, miles beyond
the farthest bear-trap, to the Forest Ranger&#8217;s
cabin. The trail was wilder than six of them had
ever imagined a trail could be. Sometimes it was
almost obliterated, but the blaze of the rangers
with its U.S. brand told them that human beings
had traversed it, and that they might safely follow.
At noon they had reached the cabin&mdash;a lonely eyrie
looking down into the gorge of the river. Behind
it unbroken forests stretched for miles.</p>
<p>The ranger was away upon his beat, but his door
stood hospitably open, and they had gladly entered,
sure that a welcome was intended. In his little
kitchen they had eaten dinner, leaving some of their
bacon as a gift. Then an idea had seized Aunt Nan.
Why not pick some of the raspberries which grew
in profusion near by, and cook a quart of them
as winter preserves for the ranger? It did not take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
very long for nine pair of hands to pick three quarts
instead of one, and within an hour, sugar having
been found in the pantry, the berries were cooking
on the little stove. Jars, too, were discovered, and
at three o&#8217;clock when the boys had brought the
horses, five cooks in khaki surveyed their gift with
proud eyes. They had ridden hurriedly away, realizing
that they were already late if they wanted
Sagebrush Point for a camping-place; and three
miles below the cabin Vivian had discovered the
loss of her wrist-watch, a birthday gift from her
father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry a bit, Vivian,&#8221; Virginia said,
reassuringly, as she urged Pedro up the steep trail.
&#8220;We&#8217;d just as soon ride back as not, and I wouldn&#8217;t
have you lose the watch for the world. Of course
the ranger would keep it safe for us, but there&#8217;s no
knowing when we could get away up here again.
It&#8217;s best to go now when we&#8217;re only three miles
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dead sure it&#8217;s right on the table,&#8221; said Carver.
&#8220;I saw you put it there, Vivian, when you got
ready to wash the dishes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>Carver Standish was right. The watch was on
the table where she had left it. The cabin seemed
more lonely than ever as they hurried away. The
rush of the river hundreds of feet below, the drowsy
hum of the August insects, and the sound of their
horses&#8217; feet upon the stones alone broke the silence.
Vivian shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate it here, now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry back
to the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was impossible to hurry down the steep,
rocky trail. The horses were tired, and a misstep
or a stumble would be dangerous. Pedro, sure of
himself on any trail, led the way, and Vivian and
Carver followed, weaving right and left down the
mountain side. More than once Carver glanced apprehensively
at his watch. It was growing late&mdash;nearly
five already!&mdash;and Virginia had told Donald
they would be at Sagebrush Point at six! It was
impossible. They could never make it!</p>
<p>Vivian was worried, too. She hated the shadows
that began to creep in among the trees, the lonely
call of a bird in the timber, the coolness that came
as the afternoon waned. She shivered again, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
at the first ford, where they had separated more
than an hour before, the rawhide thongs in one of
her stirrups broke, and caused a second delay.</p>
<p>Carver&#8217;s none too agile fingers laced and re-tied
the thong. Virginia allowed Pedro to nibble at the
quaking-asps and tried to be patient while she
watched the repairing. More than once she was
tempted to jump from her saddle and do the work
herself, but she knew that Carver would resent the
intrusion. Carver Standish III heartily disliked
any intimation that he was a tenderfoot. Safe and
satisfied in the citadel of New England birth and
ancestry, he still was averse to any suggestion of
inferiority in Wyoming. Virginia liked Carver,
though she knew him far better now than she had
ever dreamed she should. She liked him in spite
of the tinge of snobbishness which would creep in
now and then, try as he did to conceal it. She even
liked him during the ten minutes he took to lace the
thong when she could have done it in three.</p>
<p>It was growing dark when they at last swung
into the easier, grass-grown trail of the lower mountains&mdash;dark
and cold. The realization that they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
already two miles from supper and the others, together
with the knowledge that there was still the
Canyon Path to cross, made them all silent and very
grave. They hurried their horses through the last
of the tallest timber and out upon the bare summit
of a mountain, which looked down across the valley
and the river to a point beyond. As they gazed,
flames shot up from the point where a newly-kindled
fire was welcoming the first star. Dark specks were
visible about the fire&mdash;persons moving here and
there. Sagebrush Point&mdash;a mile across the valley,
two by the trail!</p>
<p>Carver looked questioningly at Virginia, and
found his answer in the smile she gravely gave him.
They would go no farther. Carver knew it before
Virginia discovered the paper. Vivian suspected,
but would not know. They sat quietly in their
saddles while she rode Pedro close to a great pine
which bore a ranger&#8217;s sign, burned in a piece of
wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two miles to Sagebrush Point,&#8221; read the sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good camping-place. Dangerous trailing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Below the sign was a folded piece of paper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
fastened by Donald&#8217;s scarf-pin to the tree, and bearing
Virginia&#8217;s name. She read it silently and with
difficulty in the fast-fading light.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as I thought,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;When
Donald reached here and saw what a long time it
had taken, he knew we couldn&#8217;t make the Point. He
says not to attempt it if it&#8217;s after six, and it&#8217;s a quarter
of seven now. I wouldn&#8217;t try the Canyon Path
for anything in this light, and there&#8217;s no other way
to go. We&#8217;ll just have to camp here, that&#8217;s all!
We&#8217;ve our blankets and matches and plenty of bacon
and bread, and there&#8217;s a spring near by. It won&#8217;t
be so bad. Quite an adventure!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her last words were spoken in an attempt to reassure
Vivian, who was staring at her&mdash;the epitome
of horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camp&mdash;here&mdash;Virginia! Alone! Here! In&mdash;this&mdash;wilderness!&#8221;
Vivian was monosyllabic from
terror.</p>
<p>Carver did not share Vivian&#8217;s fear, but he was
a trifle overbearing in his judgment of those about
the fire at Sagebrush Point.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Donald thought we weren&#8217;t going to make it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
why didn&#8217;t he camp here himself?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Of
course it&#8217;s all right for me, but it&#8217;s rather tough
on you and Vivian. I should think he&#8217;d have
thought of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia was quick to champion Donald. Indeed
Carver Standish III would have given much for
the place Donald held in Virginia&#8217;s estimation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Carver,&#8221; she said, frank in her displeasure,
&#8220;Donald&#8217;s one of the most thoughtful persons
in the world. Malcolm and Aunt Nan were over
at Sagebrush, and he couldn&#8217;t get word to them
before dark. Besides, he knows I&#8217;m not afraid
to camp by ourselves. They&#8217;re right across on
Sagebrush, and there&#8217;s nothing in this world to
harm us. Of course he wouldn&#8217;t have gone on for
anything if you hadn&#8217;t been here, but he knew he
could depend on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The knowledge of New England ancestry could
not keep Carver Standish from feeling small as he
unsaddled the horses, and tied them in among the
trees. Then, considering work a good antidote, he
cut brush and brought dry sticks for a fire. A dead
cedar promised logs enough for the night, and these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Carver cut, trimmed, and piled. Vivian, unable
as yet to comprehend the situation, stood looking
off toward the fire on the point, and wished with
all her heart that she had wings. Virginia unstrapped
the blankets and laid them upon a fallen
log. Then, the big revolver in her hand, she waited
only for the fire to give those watching on Sagebrush
the signals agreed upon. At last the flame-colored
smoke burst into tongues of fire, leaping,
crackling tongues which told the anxious watchers
on Sagebrush that the note had been found and
that all was well. A moment later three shots
from the mountain opposite tore away the stillness.
Donald sent back an answering three. Then
five in quick succession came from Virginia&#8217;s
revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the old signal we&#8217;ve always used in hunting,&#8221;
Donald explained to Mary, Priscilla, and Jack
who were standing beside him. &#8220;It means, &#8216;We&#8217;re
going to camp here.&#8217; I knew Virginia would decide
on that. She always does the sensible thing
anyway,&#8221; he added proudly.</p>
<p>Malcolm and Aunt Nan, standing near the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
water&#8217;s edge, watched the flames of Virginia&#8217;s fire
as they blazed skyward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never quite realized before what Virginia&#8217;s
made of,&#8221; said Aunt Nan thoughtfully. &#8220;If her
Grandmother Webster were here this minute, I think
perhaps she&#8217;d realize that there <i>are</i> qualities which
balance being born in New England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; returned Malcolm, a little doubtfully.
&#8220;Perhaps she would. I&#8217;ve known New Englanders
to realize several things. The trouble is they&#8217;re
very much averse to admitting it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the three on the summit across the
valley had dined, frugally to be sure, and somewhat
silently on bread and bacon. Now sweater-clad
they sat before the fire, and munched at some
sweet chocolate which Carver had discovered in
his coat pocket. With every nibble Vivian peered
among the trees behind her, glanced fearfully right
and left, and ended by gazing with longing eyes
at the fire on Sagebrush Point. Carver hugged his
knees, and rocked idly to and fro. Virginia gazed
thoughtfully into the flames. To her a night in
a mountain forest was a privilege, whether three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
or nine shared its glories. To be sure, a tent would
be a distinct addition, but since they had none
they must do without it. Its absence was but an
incident, and gave her little anxiety&mdash;far less, in
fact, than the fear which she detected in the blue
eyes of Vivian. For to Vivian the approaching
night was a terrible ordeal through which she
must go. Her reason fled away to parts unknown,
and only imagination remained to create a mountain
lion in every thicket, and mysterious, unearthly,
disembodied presences in the air, behind her back,
at her very elbow. She was grateful when Carver
came to sit beside her. With Virginia on the other
side, two less avenues of approach were opened.
At all events she would not talk about her fear;
and, acting upon her resolve, she did her best to
join in the conversation on school and books and
athletics.</p>
<p>Ten o&#8217;clock came, and Carver brought wood
for the fire. Then he unrolled their blankets,
spreading them over pine boughs already cut and
placed upon the ground. The ground itself was
a good enough mattress for him, he said, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
rolled in his blanket Indian-fashion, and lay down
under a great pine. They need have no anxiety
as to the fire. He probably should sleep but little,
and would replenish it whenever wood was needed.
If they wanted a thing or became frightened in
the night, they should speak to him.</p>
<p>Vivian, sleepy in spite of her fears, lay down
upon the boughs, her head in Virginia&#8217;s lap. She
knew she should not close her eyes, but she might
as well rest. If a bear or a mountain lion came,
it would make little difference whether she were
sitting or reclining. Virginia was not sleepy. She
preferred to sit up.</p>
<p>In half an hour a long, resigned snore from the
neighborhood of the great pine proved that Carver
Standish had forgotten all about fires and protection.
Virginia smiled to herself as she reached for
more wood. There was bacon in camp and undoubtedly
bears on the mountain. The combination
made a big fire desirable. Moreover, she was determined
that the Sagebrush Point fire, replenished
from time to time by a black dot, should not eclipse
her own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sit up a minute, Vivian,&#8221; she whispered, trying
to rise. &#8220;I want to get one of those big logs which
I can&#8217;t reach from here. I&#8217;ll be back in a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when she returned with the log, Vivian&#8217;s head
had dropped upon the blankets, and the flames which
leaped up a moment later showed her, to Virginia&#8217;s
joy, to be fast asleep.</p>
<p>So the founder of the Vigilantes was the only one
left to guard the fortunes of the camp. She took
her station near the edge of the slope, a little distance
from the fire, drew her blanket close around
her, and began her vigil. There was so much to
see and to think about! She was glad she felt wide-awake.</p>
<p>Deep in the gorge below her, the river called with
a thousand voices. Down in the valley the pine trees
reared their heads&mdash;little spear points pricking the
purple blackness of the night. The fire on Sagebrush
sparkled like a single jewel in a vast setting.
Far above and beyond the valley rose the opposite
height, dark and indistinct&mdash;a bridge between two
worlds. To Virginia she was like an eagle, secure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
in his nest on the topmost pinnacle of a cliff, and
looking forth upon his domain.</p>
<p>Now she turned her face upward toward the deep,
almost transparent blue of the midnight sky. It was
set with myriads of stars&mdash;great arc-lights, beacons
at sea, flickering candle-flames. A star fell&mdash;it was
one of the beacons&mdash;and came earthward, trailing
glory in its wake. Then, the path blazed, another
followed, and a third. The last was a little candle-flame,
almost too tiny to find its way alone. The
Milky Way was a great, golden trail across the sky.
If souls traversed it on their way to the Great
Throne, as she had believed when she was a little
girl, they would have no difficulty to-night in finding
their way. She traced its triumphant course
across the heavens. It seemed to begin on earth,
she thought to herself, and come back to earth again
after its journey skyward. That might break in
pieces her childhood dream. But perhaps there were
Great Thrones on earth, too, if one only searched
far enough. Who knew that there were not?</p>
<p>After all, Life was a search. She was beginning
to realize that more every day. It meant a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
seeking after the best things. What were those
best things, she wondered? Had she discovered
the trail which, like the Milky Way, led to them?
Friendship was one, she concluded&mdash;the real friendship
which never demanded more than it was willing
to give. And Service was another&mdash;the desire
to help people over the hard, rocky places&mdash;to be
a comrade, not just a spectator. Dorothy had discovered
that. Then the Love of Beautiful Things
must surely be a third&mdash;the love of books and pictures
and of all the wonderful treasures of the out-of-doors.
These were not all. There were others
to be found far ahead, Virginia knew&mdash;treasures
more wonderful than any yet discovered&mdash;if one
searched and were worthy of finding them.</p>
<p>At least she knew she had discovered the key
which would open the gate to the trail. She felt of
it upon her waist. To be &#8220;Ever Vigilant&#8221; would
open the door. To be watchful of one&#8217;s opportunities;
never to scorn a chance to serve; to guard
against the cheap and the unlovely in books and
thoughts; to keep the windows of one&#8217;s soul shining
and clean, so that the light of all things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
beautiful might shine in. She held the little pin close
in her hand. She and Priscilla and Dorothy
and Mary and Vivian would keep to the trail
together.</p>
<p>Life was such a great, big thing she said to herself.
Her breath sobbed in her throat at the
thought. It was like a day in April&mdash;cloudy and
sunny and wind-blown and rainy. She wanted her
own life to be like that. Then she could understand
the storms and clouds in other lives, and
prove she was a comrade and not just an onlooker!</p>
<p>The fire died down and she went for more wood.
As she placed a big log on the glowing embers and
turned away from the heat as it burst into flame,
she saw that the fire on Sagebrush was rekindled
also. She could discern a shadowy shape in the
light of it. Donald, perhaps. He loved the night,
too. She had forgotten Donald for the moment
when she chose her comrades for the Long Trail,
but he must go. She had followed trails with Donald
all her life, and on this great journey she needed
his comradeship more than ever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>It was one o&#8217;clock, her little watch said&mdash;time to
sleep. The great log with another added would
last till morning. She rolled the second against
the first, and lay down beside Vivian. The heat
from the fire made her drowsy, and she soon slept.
The flames leaped against the darkness; Pedro
awakened and neighed questioningly; another star
fell from the sky. Carver, Virginia, and Vivian
were all in lands of their own. All at once a hideous
yell shattered the night silence. It shrieked
and quavered and moaned, and at last died away
in an echo that encircled the valley. Virginia,
mounting a rocky hill with Donald, sat up suddenly.
A figure enshrouded in blankets stood beside
her. Vivian mercifully slept on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; screamed the half-asleep and wholly frightened
Carver Standish III. &#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A mountain lion,&#8221; said Virginia, shaking in spite
of herself. &#8220;But he&#8217;s miles away across the valley.
I&#8217;m glad Vivian didn&#8217;t wake up. She&#8217;d have been
scared to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t blame her!&#8221; replied Carver in a stentorian
whisper. &#8220;I never heard anything like it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
in my life. My! I&#8217;m sleepy! It&#8217;s most eleven,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia smiled into the darkness. Not for
worlds would she have told Carver of his unsuccessful
vigil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Carver,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s past eleven!&#8221;</p>
<p>Alone she watched the day come as she had
watched it go. She saw the last stars fade away,
and the half-light of early morning greet the eastern
mountains. She felt in a strange silence the
mystery and majesty of dawn. A mourning dove
in a far-away thicket said farewell to the night; an
early morning wind stirred the quaking-asps; an
orange and yellow bird left his nest and mate to
fly across the valley toward a sky-line of his own
hue. The trees stood expectant. Then the light
came in long, golden rays. It was day.</p>
<p>By six they were on their way to breakfast with
their fellow-campers at Sagebrush&mdash;Vivian, incredulous
that the night was really over and that she
had slept; Carver, secretly much disturbed over his
protecting powers; Virginia, eager, radiant, buoyant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Donald waited for them on the other side
of the Canyon Path, and watched their safe transit.
Aunt Nan and the others were ready at the camp
with welcomes and words of genuine admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have been worried to death about you,&#8221; said
Priscilla with her arm around Virginia, &#8220;if it hadn&#8217;t
been for Carver&#8217;s being there. Yes, I would, Virginia.
I don&#8217;t care how much you know about
camping. A man&#8217;s being around makes a heap
of difference. You know it does!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed the loyal Virginia.</p>
<p>But Carver Standish III drank his coffee in silence,
glad for once that the cup was large enough
to hide his face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE ROMAN EMPEROR</h3>
</div>

<p>The late August days came relentlessly on, each
in turn being seized by the Vigilantes and placed
in a treasure-house of never-to-be-forgotten joys.
The month which they had planned in June was
lengthening into six weeks. Mr. Hunter and Virginia
had insisted and Aunt Nan seemed very loath
to go. Already they were quite Westernized. They
&#8220;rustled&#8221; and &#8220;cached&#8221; and &#8220;packed&#8221; things without
even stopping to think, and <i>r&#8217;s</i> were unmistakably
creeping into Priscilla&#8217;s strictly Bostonian
speech. What <i>would</i> the Winthrop family say?</p>
<p>Every day the country grew lovelier. A veil of
bronze and purple was being laid softly over the
foot-hills, and the waiting wheat stood golden. Day
after day the sun rose in glory, and after a cloudless
journey set in a golden sea. In the woods
the berries of the kinnikinnick grew red, and on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
lawn the mountain ash trees stood clothed in holiday
attire. The air was clear and bracing; the
nights were cold. One morning the highest mountain
was white with snow, which, when the sun
rose higher, hurried away, as though it had told
a secret. September was on the way, and these were
her forerunners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never supposed,&#8221; announced Priscilla one
morning at breakfast, &#8220;that weeks could go so fast.
It makes old age seem awfully close. And still
I know how slowly they go sometimes, like January
at St. Helen&#8217;s, for instance. Just sixteen more
days, and we&#8217;ll be going back East, Virginia. Dad
says if I&#8217;m not back by the tenth, they&#8217;ll motor to
the White Mountains without me. I&#8217;m afraid I
can&#8217;t help feeling superior when I view the White
Mountains after seeing these!&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia was busily counting on her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to remember just what we&#8217;ve done
and what we haven&#8217;t done,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Then we
can see what&#8217;s left. We&#8217;ve ridden hundreds of miles,
and we&#8217;ve climbed mountains, and trapped a bear,
and shot gophers, and fished, and homesteaded, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
camped, and visited Aunt Deborah and Jean MacDonald.
I&#8217;m so glad Jean went to Aunt Deborah&#8217;s
with us. It was such fun having her along. Then
we&#8217;ve been up to Mystic Lake, and out on the range
with Joe and William, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t visited the Roman Emperor,&#8221;
interrupted her father. &#8220;I stopped at his place yesterday
on my way home from Willow Creek, and
found him at home, flag out and all. He promised
me some water-cress, but I couldn&#8217;t wait for it. You
see,&#8221; he added, smiling at the puzzled faces around
him, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t every one who can see the Emperor.
It takes a special errand. In this case, it&#8217;s water-cress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go this very day!&#8221; cried Virginia. &#8220;Cottonwood
Canyon can wait! Don and I&#8217;ve been planning
it all along, but he said Mr.&mdash;the Emperor,
I mean&mdash;was away up in the mountains. I&#8217;ll telephone
over for the boys this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not to question had become a Vigilante principle;
and not to appear too curious, another. Still
the mystery which filled their minds concerning the
Emperor was ill-concealed. They knew Patrick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
Sheehan, the old Vigilante, who lived on the Lone
Mountain trail, and queer Aunt Susan Nevitt, who
was reputed to have a bag of gold nuggets in the
cellar of her tumble-down cabin. But of this personage,
the Roman Emperor, they had surely never
heard! Curiosity lent haste to their fingers, and
in half an hour they were ready to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;His ca&mdash;<i>estate</i> is off the road to Willow Creek,&#8221;
Virginia explained as they went out to greet the
boys. &#8220;We&#8217;ve ridden by the driveway loads of
times, but I knew he wasn&#8217;t at home by his flag not
being out. That&#8217;s the sign. It&#8217;s that way in England,
you know, at the king&#8217;s and dukes&#8217; palaces.
When they&#8217;re at home, the flag is flying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Priscilla, as she mounted Cyclone.
&#8220;Is the Emperor old?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather. He&#8217;s nearly eighty. You see, he&#8217;s been
reigning twenty-five years, hasn&#8217;t he, Don?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he commenced when Malcolm was of no
account&mdash;twenty-five years or so ago. He&#8217;s met
with lots of reverses, too. He was telling me just
before you got home how the Senate wouldn&#8217;t vote
him any money to fix up the estate. He&#8217;ll probably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
apologize. Everybody ready? Come on!&#8221; commanded
Don.</p>
<p>They rode for a mile across the open prairie, then
turned south into the Willow Creek road, which
followed the foot-hills. Conversation regarding
the Emperor was tantalizing, and questioning was
forbidden. Accordingly, they pocketed their curiosity,
and devoted their time to one another, and
to the signs of approaching autumn upon the brown
hillsides. Pedro and MacDuff, eager for a gallop,
left the other horses, and dashed along a three-path,
grass-grown trail which encircled the hill
and met the road again a mile beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the chance I wanted,&#8221; said Donald, reining
in MacDuff to ride beside Virginia. &#8220;I want
to ask you about Carver. I can&#8217;t make him out
lately. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter. He&#8217;s been
queer ever since that night on the mountain&mdash;last
Tuesday, wasn&#8217;t it? Of course he&#8217;s all right to
the folks, and all that, but he&#8217;s stuck by himself
more or less, and seemed stirred up over something.
Dave, the man we got last winter, complained to
Dad yesterday about Carver&#8217;s being rather officious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
with the men. Dad smoothed it over, of course,
and explained how Carver didn&#8217;t understand that
that sort of thing doesn&#8217;t go out here. But it kind
of worries me. Everything went all right up
there, didn&#8217;t it, Virginia&mdash;on the mountain, I
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not even Donald could detect hesitation in Virginia&#8217;s
reply. If Carver still chose to keep the ill-gotten
rôle of protector, it was not up to her to
take it from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, Don,&#8221; she said promptly.
&#8220;Everything was perfectly all right. I guess Carver
wasn&#8217;t awfully pleased at first when he found we
had to stay. You see, he&mdash;he hasn&#8217;t much patience
with Vivian when she&#8217;s nervous. But she did splendidly,
and tried her best not to show how she felt
inside. And I couldn&#8217;t see why Carver didn&#8217;t enjoy
himself. He certainly seemed to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald was plainly puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it gets me! He&#8217;s not a fellow
you can reach very easily either. If it were Jack,
I&#8217;d ask him just what the matter was, but somehow
it&#8217;s different with Carver. There&#8217;s always something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
in the way. I believe it&#8217;s&mdash;too much New
England!&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much of it&#8217;s a dreadful barrier,&#8221; she observed.
&#8220;Grandmother Webster had too much when
I first went to Vermont, but I found a little path
that led around it after I&#8217;d searched a long time. I
think part of the trouble with Carver is that he&#8217;s
just one of us out here. He isn&#8217;t looked up to
the way he is at home. Priscilla knew him last summer,
you know, and she&#8217;s told me about him. We
were talking about it just last night, because we&#8217;ve
noticed he&#8217;s queer lately. Priscilla says he&#8217;s always
been looked up to by boys and girls of his age
because his family&#8217;s so old, and his father so wealthy,
and his grandfather a colonel. In New England,
you know, those things count, especially the family
and the colonel. Then, besides, Carver&#8217;s bright and
fine-looking and an only son. Out here, you see,
Don, we don&#8217;t care so much about colonels and old
families and money. They&#8217;re all right, of course,
if you have them, but you&#8217;ve an equal chance if
you don&#8217;t.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Carver&#8217;s learning that we&#8217;re right after
all,&#8221; said Donald thoughtfully. &#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s seeing
that ancestry won&#8217;t make a man. It&#8217;s hard
to admit those things, I know that. I hated to
admit that the Eastern fellows at school had
better manners than we cow-punchers from this
part of the country. But &#8217;twas so all the
same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia allowed Pedro to nibble at the quaking-asps
before she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come out all right, Don,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let&#8217;s worry! Sometimes I think he&#8217;s like Captain
Myles in the poem. Priscilla does, too. He gets
angry all at once, and then hates himself for it.
By and by he&#8217;ll be all right again, and as nice as
ever the Captain was at John Alden&#8217;s wedding.
Come on, let&#8217;s round the hill! We&#8217;re nearly at Mr.
Livy&#8217;s, and they&#8217;ll think we&#8217;re too exclusive for
worlds!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Emperor&#8217;s flag was out&mdash;a diminutive and
tattered Old Glory, whose shreds fluttered in the
wind. It was tacked to a wooden box, which,
mounted on a log at the entrance to a narrow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
winding path, served as the Emperor&#8217;s mail-box.
The name</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'><i>A. C. Levinsky</i></p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>was painted upon the side facing the road. As they
turned into the path, Priscilla halted Cyclone.
There was a decided tinge of stubbornness in her
voice as she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going another step,&#8221; she announced,
&#8220;until I know about this Emperor business. I&#8217;m
not going to embarrass any poor old thing who may
live in this wilderness by not knowing anything
about him. Come, Donald! You&#8217;ve got to tell!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I intended to all along just as soon as we reached
the bridge,&#8221; said Donald. &#8220;I know the Emperor,
and I wouldn&#8217;t have him hurt for anything. His
real name is Augustus Cæsar Levinsky&mdash;at least,
his last name is Levinsky, and I guess he hitched
on the first. He&#8217;s a poor old prospector who&#8217;s been
in this valley fifty years. He claims he was the
very first to come, and perhaps he was. He&#8217;s dug
holes all over these mountains looking for gold, and
you&#8217;re always coming on him panning out gravel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
in some creek. Some one grub-stakes him up here
to get his land. By that, I mean,&#8221; he added, noting
the puzzled faces of his listeners, &#8220;that some one
gives him food and clothes and a promise to bury
him for the sake of the land he&#8217;s homesteaded.
That&#8217;s the way with old Pat Sheehan, and a lot
of fellows around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now he thinks he&#8217;s the Emperor of Rome,&#8221;
said Virginia, continuing the Emperor&#8217;s story.
&#8220;He&#8217;s been thinking that for twenty-five years, Father
says. Some one gave him an old Roman History
years ago, and he knows it all by heart. We
all call him Mr. Livy around here. He says he
doesn&#8217;t feel like asking his friends to title him. He
sounds pathetic, but he isn&#8217;t at all. He&#8217;s the happiest
man you ever saw. He&#8217;s like the verse at the
beginning of Emerson&#8217;s <i>Essay on History</i>. He believes
he&#8217;s Cæsar, and so he is. You&#8217;ll be surprised
at the way he speaks, and the fine manners he has.
It&#8217;s believing he&#8217;s the Emperor that&#8217;s done those
things, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Less curious but more interested, they followed
the cool, shady path that led toward the imperial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
estates. They crossed a bridge over a creek, green
with fresh water-cress, their open sesame. Upon
the railing was tacked a second flag&mdash;this one new
and untorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Emperor must have had a present,&#8221; observed
Virginia. &#8220;You catch your first glimpse of
the palace around this curve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around the curve they went, and into an open,
path-cut field through which the creek meandered.
The palace lay in the farthest corner. It did not
even stand. Its old logs, disjoined and askew, were
all but on the ground. How the roof managed to
hold the chimney was a mystery. Perhaps, after
all, it was the chimney which acted as a prop to
the roof. A lean-to of poles, sod, and bark served
as an entrance, and boasted a door. Mountain-fringe
and other vines had taken root in the sod,
and were undoubtedly helping to hold the structure
together.</p>
<p>An undisturbed, unbroken silence reigned over
the imperial residence. The Emperor was doubtless
busy with affairs of state, if indeed he were
not away upon official business. Still the flag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
disproved his absence. He might be simply viewing
the domain.</p>
<p>Suddenly from the lean-to came such fierce barking
that more than one Vigilante made a hasty return
to the safety of her saddle. Then the door
opened, and, preceded by his dogs, the Emperor
came out into the sunshine. He had doubtless been
too absorbed to note their coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down, Nero! Down, Trajan!&#8221; they heard him
say. &#8220;Is this the way you receive my guests?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dogs ceased barking, and stood on either side
of him as he surveyed his visitors. They in turn
surveyed him. They saw a tall, slight old man,
still unbent. It seemed as though dignity defied
time and kept him upright. His frayed white shirt
was spotless, and his gray trousers, held up by
thongs of skin, were neatly darned and clean. The
lines in his smoothly shaven face vied in intricacy
with the streets of Boston; his thin hair was neatly
brushed; his faded blue eyes were gentle. He was
the kind of an old man to whom one instinctively
showed deference. Moreover, he was the Roman
Emperor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>The hats of Jack, Carver, and Donald came off
as they greeted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are our friends, Mr. Livy,&#8221; Donald explained.
&#8220;You remember I told you some time ago
that they were coming. And you know Virginia
Hunter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Livy did know Virginia. He and Nero and
Trajan came forward all together to greet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see your face again, Miss Virginia,&#8221;
said the Emperor. &#8220;Your father was here day before
yesterday. He mentioned water-cress. Was
that your errand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, and to see you, Mr. Livy,&#8221; answered Virginia.
&#8220;My friends wished to come. I hope you&#8217;re
not too busy to show them around a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Emperor was not too busy. He said this
with a bow, which was many times repeated as he
was presented to the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I regard you as friends,&#8221; he said with dignity,
&#8220;otherwise I should hesitate to show you the palace.
There is a sad lack of funds of late&mdash;a sad
lack! All the Senate&#8217;s appropriations are being
expended on the new aqueduct, and on new roads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
through the provinces. The roads hold our great
possessions together, and the Emperor&#8217;s home can
wait. But next year all will be different. Then I
shall again plead my case, and money will be forthcoming.
This way, please, young ladies and gentlemen.
We will first view the grounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>His guests in respectful silence followed him
down a path toward the creek over which he had
placed a little foot-bridge. A fish jumped as they
stepped upon the logs, and swam away to the safe
shelter of the water-cress.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stream is well-stocked with the best of
trout,&#8221; explained their host. &#8220;It is my pastime
to catch them in other streams and to bring them
here. You remember Horace upon his Sabine farm?
Such pleasures as he enjoyed are mine. Yes, there
is an abundance of cress. We will wait until later
to gather it that it may be fresh and crisp.&#8221;</p>
<p>They followed the stream in its meandering
course through the fields. Their guide pointed out
to them this and that beauty&mdash;the fringed gentians
in a thicket near the water&#8217;s edge; a late wild rose
which saw its pink reflection in the still, amber
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
water. It was as though he, aided by the Senate&#8217;s
money, had laid out the grounds himself, such was
his pride in them. Another foot-bridge brought
them back to the other side, and to the field-path
which led to the house.</p>
<p>The Emperor felt called upon to apologize again
before opening the door of the lean-to.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Senate still appropriates for conquests,&#8221; he
said gravely. &#8220;I am much opposed. The Empire
is large enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went within. The lean-to was a chaotic
place, filled to overflowing with pick-axes, spades,
elk-horns, musk-rat traps, mining tools, samples of
coal, and curiously-colored pieces of rock. Some
skins, stretched on boards, were drying on the wall;
some rude fishing-rods stood in one corner. The
little room was strangely like the Emperor&#8217;s poor,
befuddled brain.</p>
<p>The room in the main house was hardly imperial.
A small, rickety stove, bearing corn-meal porridge
in a tin basin, stood in the center. In one corner
was the Emperor&#8217;s bed, piled high with skins; in
another, a scarred and battered table. Some ragged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
articles of clothing hung about the room. By the
one window was his chair, and on the floor close
by lay a soiled and tattered book&mdash;Smith&#8217;s <i>History
of Ancient Rome!</i> The Emperor picked it up
eagerly and showed it to his guests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was reading over again all that my reign has
accomplished when you came,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are
the fire department, and the police, and the new
roads, and the patronage of poets. I feel encouraged
when I think it all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you would,&#8221; complimented Virginia.
&#8220;And then think of all the things you did
before you were Emperor! Think of the early days
out here&mdash;the Vigilantes and all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Livy&#8217;s faded blue eyes gleamed. Epochs
had become as nothing to him. Now he was Emperor
of Rome, and then he had fought against
robbers and road-agents in a new country. It was
all one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I remember it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I remember
how we hung seven robbers in one night
from a single cottonwood! Don&#8217;t I remember how
old Jim Gillis said to me: &#8216;For God&#8217;s sake, Levinsky,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
get me one last drink before I die!&#8217; I got it for
him, and in a minute more he was dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack and Carver&#8217;s eyes shone. They thought old
tales were forthcoming, but they did not know the
Emperor. He said no more of Vigilante days, but
turned toward the stove to stir the porridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the water-cress for you directly,&#8221; he
said with a return to his old dignity. &#8220;Give it to
your father with my compliments, Miss Virginia.
I sent some but recently to the censor. No payment,
I insist!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus dismissed, his guests passed reluctantly outside.
Ten minutes later they were making their
farewells. The Emperor stood between Nero and
Trajan, and watched them go. He was glad of
occasional visitors, but more glad to return to the
knotty problems which were before the Empire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he called as they rode away. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
forget to notice the statue of Athena just within the
gate. It&#8217;s a recent gift from the Governor of
Gaul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he went within the palace, passed through
the lofty atrium, and entered his private room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
where he sat down to continue the story of his
glorious reign.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his guests searched for the Athena.
There might be something&mdash;a post, perhaps&mdash;that
signified the goddess of wisdom to the plastic mind
of poor Mr. Levinsky. But they could find nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s only a dream like all the other things,&#8221;
said Priscilla. &#8220;Poor man! I can&#8217;t see how he can
reconcile things in his own mind!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; explained Virginia. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
lovely part of it! He&#8217;s the happiest Emperor I&#8217;ve
ever known of in all my life!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>ON THE MESA</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Pedro,&#8221; said Virginia, &#8220;do you realize for one
little minute what&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedro looked back and whinnied. He realized
at least that something was agitating his mistress.
But half an hour since she had run out of the house
to where he was feeding beneath the cottonwoods,
and hurried him to the corral where she had saddled
and bridled him herself. She had been crying
then. Quick little sobs were shaking her shoulders.
Then she had sprung upon his back and ridden
like mad across the prairie to Elk Creek Valley.
Had MacDuff been along, he would not have
minded; but it was too warm at mid-day to gallop
all alone. Once during that wild ride she had
laughed, and once she had leaned forward and
put her arms around his neck. It was all a very
strange proceeding. Now she had mercifully halted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
him on the brow of the mesa, and was allowing
him to rest and feed while she sat in silence and
looked across the sagebrush stretches to the mountains.</p>
<p>A long silence. The air throbbed with a hidden
insect chorus. Little waves of heat shimmered
above the mesa. Jean MacDonald&#8217;s three cows,
searching for better feeding-grounds, passed by and
gazed with grave, inquisitive eyes at Pedro and Virginia.
Pedro fed on where he was. At last the
girl upon his back spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro,&#8221; she began, and again Pedro raised his
head, &#8220;Pedro, I&#8217;ve decided that Life isn&#8217;t such a
strange thing after all! I&#8217;ve always thought it was
until to-day, but I guess it isn&#8217;t. I guess it just
means loving people&mdash;and things! If you love the
wrong kind of people and the things that don&#8217;t
count, why, then&mdash;why, then Life&#8217;s a sad, gray
thing. But if you love the right kind of people, the
kind who&#8217;ve learned that a primrose isn&#8217;t just a
primrose, and things like the mountain and the mesa
and <i>you</i>, Pedro&mdash;why, then, Life&#8217;s a golden thing
like to-day. And it&#8217;s the loving that makes all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
difference. I discovered that this morning when
Aunt Nan told me about Malcolm. When I was in
Vermont I thought that Grandmother and Aunt
Nan were about the happiest people I&#8217;d seen; but
this morning, when I saw the light in Aunt Nan&#8217;s
eyes, I understood. I guess it&#8217;s a home that makes
all the difference, Pedro&mdash;a home you and <i>somebody
else</i> make together!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedro fed on, glad to be talked to, confident that
his mistress&#8217; world had righted itself again. A passing
cloud obscured the sun for a brief moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it was with me this morning,&#8221;
confided Virginia. &#8220;For just an instant I felt sorry.
&#8217;Twas the selfish part of me coming out. I didn&#8217;t
want any one to take a bigger piece of Aunt Nan&#8217;s
heart than mine. I didn&#8217;t want to move over and
make room for any one else&mdash;even Malcolm. But
that mean, drab feeling lasted only a moment. It
went right away, and now I&#8217;m glad, <i>glad&mdash;glad!</i>
If Grandmother Webster&#8217;s only glad, too, there
couldn&#8217;t be any greater happiness in the world, could
there, Pedro?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedro stopped feeding to look back at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
mistress, and to shake his head. Virginia laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only friend I want to-day, Pedro,&#8221;
she said, her arms around his neck, &#8220;you and a big
Something in my heart. I wanted to come away
off up here alone with you. That&#8217;s why I hurried
you so, poor dear! I wanted to hear the stillness
all around, and to look at the mountains. I wanted
to think about it, and to wonder if, some day, after
I&#8217;ve learned more things, it will come to me, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Impulsively she turned in her saddle and looked
down the foot-hills. Some one was fording the
creek. She knew it even before she heard the splash
of water. As she watched, two riders left the
ford, and turned north up the canyon trail. They
were Malcolm and Aunt Nan. Virginia turned back
toward the mountains, and sat very still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro,&#8221; she said at last, her voice breaking, &#8220;I
guess perhaps we&#8217;d better go home, don&#8217;t you?
Aunt Nan and Malcolm have found their trail, you
see. They don&#8217;t need us just now. No, I&#8217;m not
sorry! I&#8217;m glad! I just <i>know</i> it&#8217;s the most wonderful
thing in all the world!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE NEW SCHOOL-TEACHER IN BEAR CANYON</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Mr. Samuel Wilson, stretching
his boot-clad legs to their fullest extent, and twirling
his thumbs thoughtfully, &#8220;yes, sir, we&#8217;ve got to have
a teacher up in Bear Canyon. There ain&#8217;t a bit
o&#8217; use in waitin&#8217; a week for that teacher from Sheridan.
Come December, there&#8217;ll be snow, and school
not out. Accordin&#8217; to my judgment, and I&#8217;m the
chief trustee o&#8217; this district, it&#8217;s best to get some
one to teach a week until the one we&#8217;ve hired gets
here. I stopped at Ben Jarvis&#8217; place on my way
down here, and he agreed with me. Says he, &#8216;Sam,
there&#8217;d ought to be one out o&#8217; that crowd o&#8217; ladies
over to Hunter&#8217;s who could keep school a week.
They&#8217;re all raised around Boston, folks tell me.
Now you go along over, and see.&#8217; And I said I
would. What do you think, John? Ain&#8217;t there a
likely one among &#8217;em? If Virginia didn&#8217;t know the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
children so well, I&#8217;d be for choosin&#8217; her. But a
stranger&#8217;s what we want. That school seems to need
a stranger &#8217;bout every term.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the difficulty,&#8221; said Mr. Hunter. &#8220;It
is a hard school, and these girls aren&#8217;t used to
schools out here. The girl I am thinking of is
Mary Williams, but she&#8217;s young&mdash;only eighteen. I
shouldn&#8217;t even consider her if she hadn&#8217;t said the
other day that she&#8217;d like to try teaching in that
little school-house up the canyon. Of course
&#8217;twould be only for a week. They&#8217;re going back
East in a little more than two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her age ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; against her,&#8221; reassured
Mr. Wilson. &#8220;Remember Eben Judd&#8217;s girl who
kept the school last spring? She was only seventeen,
and she could thrash the biggest boy there! Supposin&#8217;
you let me talk with this girl if she&#8217;s around.
Seems to me twenty dollars a week is mighty easy
money for just keepin&#8217; school and givin&#8217; out things
you&#8217;ve got in your head a&#8217;ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter, half-sorry that he had even considered
the matter, went in search of Mary, while Mr.
Samuel Wilson stretched his legs even farther
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
across the floor, re-lit his old corn-cob pipe, and
settled himself more comfortably in his chair. He
did not rise when Mary, forewarned but very
eager, came into the room a few minutes later,
but he did remove his pipe. Then he stated his
errand, while Mary, feeling very professional, listened
with the deference due Mr. Wilson&#8217;s position
as chief trustee of the Bear Canyon District.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want,&#8221; concluded the chief trustee, with
a wave of his hand, after he had explained all the
difficulties and expatiated on all the joys of the
Bear Canyon school, &#8220;what we want is a teacher
who can start things right. A heap depends on
the startin&#8217; things have in this world, I&#8217;ve noticed.
Now you look like a spunky young lady. Ain&#8217;t
afraid o&#8217; big boys, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary, with the memory of Eben Judd&#8217;s daughter
and the biggest boy fresh in her mind, hesitated.
Bear Canyon might offer problems too big for her
inexperienced hands. Then she summoned an extra
amount of dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely isn&#8217;t necessary to thrash them, Mr. Wilson,
if you can get along with them some other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
way. No, I&#8217;m not at all afraid of them. Are
there many big ones?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson considered for a moment. No, there
were not many. Ben Jarvis&#8217; big boy Allan was the
worst, and even he wasn&#8217;t bad if he had enough
to do. The trouble was he led all the others, and
if he once got &#8220;contrary,&#8221; trouble arose. Mary
inwardly resolved that he should not get &#8220;contrary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now up here in Bear Canyon,&#8221; Mr. Wilson
further remarked, &#8220;we&#8217;re strong on figurin&#8217;. How
are you on arithmetic?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary&#8217;s heart fell. Dismal visions of cube root
and compound proportion came to torment her.
Her ship, sailing smoothly but a moment since, had
apparently struck a reef. Then a never-failing
imagination came to her rescue. She saw Priscilla
solving her problems in the evening at the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arithmetic isn&#8217;t exactly my specialty, Mr. Wilson,&#8221;
she said brightly. &#8220;That is, I don&#8217;t love it
as I do other studies; but I assure you I shall be
quite able to teach it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief trustee rose from his seat, knocked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
ashes from his pipe into the fire-place, and took his
hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re hired for the week, then,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;at twenty dollars. I&#8217;ll stop in at Ben Jarvis&#8217; on
my way home and tell him. School begins Monday
morning at nine. I may drop in myself durin&#8217;
the week to see how things is goin&#8217;. Good-mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary stood in the middle of the room, paying
no heed to the curious voices which called her
from the porch. She saw the chief trustee ride
past the window on his way to tell Ben Jarvis that
she was elected. She pictured the incorrigible Allan
Jarvis spending the Sabbath in the invention of mischief.
It had come too suddenly. She could not
realize that she was actually a Wyoming school-teacher.
Now the time which she had thought to
be four years&#8217; distant had come&mdash;the time to begin
to realize the ideals she had shaped for herself
upon the teaching and the personality of her adored
Miss Wallace.</p>
<p>The voices on the porch became more curious,
and Mary, at last coming to herself, hurried out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
to tell the wonderful news. She found the Vigilantes
and Aunt Nan as interested as she herself,
and willing to sacrifice her company for five days
for the sake of Bear Canyon&#8217;s rising generation.
Priscilla offered all the proficiency in arithmetic
she possessed; Aunt Nan hurried indoors to cut and
make two aprons for the teacher; and Vivian and
Virginia went in search of pencils and paper. This
was Saturday and there was no time to lose.</p>
<p>On Monday morning at eight they all stood beneath
the cottonwoods to watch a wide-eyed and
much excited school-teacher start for Bear Canyon.
In a bag which she hung on the saddle-horn were
her pencils, papers, and new apron; in a package
strapped to the saddle was her lunch, packed
by Hannah&#8217;s interested hands; and in her heart
were excitement, misgivings, and eagerness. She
preferred to go alone, she said, as she mounted
into the saddle. They might ride up at four, and
come home with her if they liked, but she must
go alone.</p>
<p>They did go up that afternoon at four&mdash;Vivian,
Priscilla, and Virginia. As they swung around a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
bend in the road, and came upon the little school-house,
they were surprised at the stillness. Where
was everybody? The children had not gone home&mdash;that
was certain&mdash;for half a dozen horses were
picketed round about. Had the school adjourned
and gone for a picnic in the woods? That would
not be unlike the new teacher, but it would be very
unlike the former traditions of the Bear Canyon
school. No sound came from within and it was
long past four. Had the big Jarvis boy triumphed
after all, and made Mary a prisoner?</p>
<p>After five minutes of patient, puzzled waiting
they added their horses to those already grazing
among the sagebrush, and stole quietly to the open
window. The new teacher sat in the middle of
the battered, scarred, ugly little room. She held
her two youngest children upon her lap much to
the detriment of her new apron. A dirty eager
face was raised to hers from either side of her
chair. The others of her twenty charges sat as
near as the seats would permit. The big Jarvis
boy had not deigned to move toward the front&mdash;that
was too much of a concession for the first day&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
he was leaning forward in his seat, his big, shaggy,
unkempt head resting in his folded arms, his eyes
never leaving Mary&#8217;s face. She was telling them
the story of the <i>Dog of Flanders</i>. The Vigilantes,
crouching beneath the window, heard her as she
finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next day,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they came to the great
cathedral, and found Nello and Patrasche dead upon
the stone floor. People were sorry then. Alois&#8217;
father was one who came. He realized how cruel
he had been to Nello, and was ready now to help
him. But it was too late. Little Alois came also.
She begged Nello to wake and come home for the
Christmas festivities, and cried when she saw that
he could not. Then a great artist came. He had
seen Nello&#8217;s picture of the old man on the fallen
tree, and he knew that some day Nello might become
a wonderful painter, even though another
had won the Antwerp prize. He wanted to take
Nello away with him, he said, and teach him art.
But he, also, was too late, for Nello and Patrasche
had gone away together to a Kinder Country. All
their lives they had not been separated, and so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the people of their little village, sorry and ashamed,
made them one grave and laid them to rest
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence in the Bear Canyon school-house
until a little girl in a pink apron sobbed.
Sobs were at a discount in Bear Canyon, and yet
strangely enough no one laughed. Allan Jarvis,
in the back seat, was intent upon his finger-nails.
The others were gazing admiringly at their new
teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a sad story,&#8221; said the little girl, using
her pink apron for a handkerchief, &#8220;but I like it
all the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deary me!&#8221; cried the new teacher, depositing
the two littlest ones on the floor, &#8220;it&#8217;s half-past
four! We must close school at once!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that the big Jarvis boy left his seat and came
down the aisle, for the first time in his life abstaining
from pulling the hair of the girls nearest
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t I get your horse ready for you, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>The new teacher smiled gratefully upon him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, Allan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be ever
so much obliged.&#8221; And Allan Jarvis departed for
the horse sheds&mdash;a conquered hero!</p>
<p>Mary, tired but enthusiastic, told them all about
it as they rode home together, followed at a respectful
distance by a dinner-pail laden throng.
How she had arrived that morning to find Allan
Jarvis the center of a mischief-bent circle; how she
had begun the day by the most exciting shipwreck
story she knew; and how the promise of another
story before four o&#8217;clock had worked a miracle.
They were starved for stories, she said. She
thought they needed them more than arithmetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she added, &#8220;probably the Sheridan person
knows all about figures. I&#8217;m going to put all
the arithmetic classes the last thing in the afternoon,
and if we don&#8217;t get around to them, why all
right. It&#8217;s unfortunate, of course, but it can&#8217;t be
helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>One day was quite sufficient to establish the name
and the fame of the Bear Canyon school-teacher.
Around every supper-table circled tales of her wisdom,
her beauty, her strange way of speaking, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
her general superiority over any teacher Bear Canyon
had ever hired. Her ability to tell stories was
lauded to the skies, and her genius at making six
hitherto mercilessly long hours seem like three marvelously
short ones was freely advertised. History
under this new teacher had become something more
than a dog-eared text-book; geography more than
stained and torn wall-maps; reading more than a
torturesome process of making sounds. They
proudly told their parents what the Constitution
of the United States had looked like when their
teacher had last seen it; the size and shape of
Plymouth Rock as recorded by her during her last
visit there. They re-told her stories one by one
to the children at home, too young for school.
Allan Jarvis did his part. He told his father he
would go to school without a word, if the new
teacher could be persuaded to stay in Bear Canyon.</p>
<p>Because of this Mr. Benjamin Jarvis left his work
the third day, put on a clean shirt, and visited the
school himself. Mr. Samuel Wilson joined him,
as did the third trustee from farther up the canyon.
When these three gentlemen entered, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
oldest History class was engaged in reproducing the
trial of Nathan Hale, the leading man in the cast
being the big Jarvis boy. It was a novel method
of teaching history, the trustees said to themselves,
remembering the barren instruction they had received,
but it seemed effectual. That night they
offered the new teacher a permanent job in Bear
Canyon. The teacher in Sheridan was not over-anxious
to come, they said, and the position was
Mary&#8217;s if she cared to accept it.</p>
<p>But Mary was going to college, she explained to
the disappointed trustees. Perhaps, some day, she
would come back&mdash;some day when she had learned
more about teaching. As it was, Friday night must
end her labors, grateful as she was, and happy as
she felt over the reception Bear Canyon had given
her.</p>
<p>It came all too soon&mdash;Friday night. The children
stood in a disconsolate little group to bid her
good-by. They knew Bear Canyon teachers of old.
There would be no more stories, no more circuses
at recess, no more flower hunts in the woods, no
more plays. School now would become just a weary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
succession of days&mdash;all pointing toward Saturday.
Figures would take the place of reading, and the
Rhine would again be just a crooked, black line,
not a river surmounted by frowning castles and
golden with legends.</p>
<p>The little girl in the pink apron again used it as
a handkerchief as Mary rode down the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;d go to school all my life&mdash;with her!&#8221; she
said loyally.</p>
<p>The school-teacher halted at the residence of Mr.
Benjamin Jarvis, second trustee. He it was who
was to sign the check for her services, give to her
the very first money she had ever earned. He was
waiting for her, the check in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I ought to tell you, Mr. Jarvis,&#8221; said
Mary, &#8220;especially since you&#8217;re strong on figures in
Bear Canyon, that I haven&#8217;t taught many this week.
I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m very weak on system. That will
be one of the things I&#8217;ll have to learn in college,
I guess. The days have gone so fast I just haven&#8217;t
seemed to have time to get them in. And&mdash;and to
tell the truth, Mr. Jarvis, I&#8217;m not very strong on
figures myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Figures!&#8221; said Mr. Benjamin Jarvis as he shook
hands with her. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve given that boy
o&#8217; mine somethin&#8217; better&#8217;n figures, God bless you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy himself came around the house just as
Mary was mounting her horse to ride away. He
had left school before the others, and had said no
good-by. Now he came up to her, a brown paper
parcel in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rattlesnake skin I fixed for you,&#8221; he said
shyly. &#8220;You said you liked &#8217;em once. And the
heavy thing in the end&#8217;s my jack-knife. I carved
your letters on the handle. I thought it might come
in handy when you went to college.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>MR. BENJAMIN JARVIS ENTERTAINS</h3>
</div>

<p>Bear Canyon did not forget Mary. A score of
heart-broken children was proof against such oblivion.
Moreover, hope began to dawn in the hearts
beneath pink gingham and outing flannel when the
teacher from Sheridan, discouraged perhaps by a
total lack of cordiality in her students, resigned
after two lugubrious days of service. Then Mr.
Samuel Wilson, accompanied by Mr. Benjamin Jarvis
and the third trustee rode in a body to the
Hunter ranch, and offered Mary a substantial
&#8220;raise&#8221; if she would only stay on until December,
and finish the fall term so triumphantly begun.</p>
<p>The memories of the little girl in the pink apron,
together with the pleas of Mr. Benjamin Jarvis on
behalf of Allan, and the assurance of Mr. Samuel
Wilson that his children had cried &#8220;five nights runnin&#8217;&#8221;
was almost too much for Mary. In one mad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
wave of sympathy she determined to give up college
and to wire her mother that the Path of Duty
for her led unmistakably to the Bear Canyon school.
But the more mature judgment of Mr. Hunter and
Aunt Nan prevailed, and an hour later three very
reluctant trustees rode away, leaving behind them
a sad, but much relieved, school-teacher, who lay
long awake that night and pondered over the desperate
state of affairs in Bear Canyon.</p>
<p>But her worry, like most that encumbers the
world, was needless, for the County Superintendent
over at Elk Creek lent a helping hand, and sent Miss
Martha Bumps to Bear Canyon. Now Miss Bumps
was not Mary, but she was assuredly Miss Martha
Bumps, and the three trustees, disappointed as they
were not to have Mary, held their heads a trifle
higher as they drove to town. For the aforesaid
Miss Bumps was a character of renown throughout
the county, and it was only because of the whooping-cough
in the consolidated rural schools of Willow
Creek that she was prompted to forsake her larger
field and hurry to the aid of Bear Canyon.</p>
<p>For twenty-five years Miss Martha Bumps had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
dedicated her energies to the teaching of Wyoming
country schools. Some who knew her well affirmed
that she had made money thereby; and this statement
will doubtless be given credence by all who
are not themselves school-teachers. After relinquishing
the dreams in which most women of thirty
indulge, and deciding once and for all that she would
give the best of her life to teaching, she had spent
much thought and ingenuity in scheming how such
a vocation could be a distinctly pleasurable one.
Ten years of boarding in homesteaders&#8217; cabins, of
sleeping with the youngest child, and eating salt pork
three times a day, of drinking condensed milk on
ranches devoted solely to cattle, and of riding miles
to her place of business in all kinds of weather&mdash;these
experiences had been fruitful in the extreme.
Now she boarded nowhere. Instead, she lived in
her own two-room house, which, clapboarded, shingled,
windowed and doored after the manner of all
houses, was mounted upon four stout cart-wheels,
and driven by an obliging trustee of one district
to the next chosen field whenever Miss Bumps decided
that the time had come to make a change.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
Arriving at her destination, the house was drawn
to the best site near the school, the horses were
unhitched, and the trustee, riding and leading,
started homeward, leaving Miss Bumps to begin
her double labors in her new situation.</p>
<p>Now, although this rather unusual mode of living
on wheels had attracted much attention and
comment, it must be conceded (and will by all
country school-teachers) that it was decidedly superior
to boarding. In her small but spotless
kitchen, Miss Bumps cooked the food which no
homesteader&#8217;s cabin afforded, and at night slept
luxuriously in her own comfortable bed which
nearly filled her other room. All day she gave herself
untiringly to her profession. In the evenings
she sat by her small air-tight stove, read, and
tatted!</p>
<p>To this last-named accomplishment Miss Bumps
had dedicated fifteen years of practice until expert
proficiency had made eyes unnecessary. She tatted
while she read, tatted while she taught, tatted while
she watched the potatoes boiling for dinner. Some
even asserted that they had seen her tat on horseback
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
with all the diligence attributed to Bertha
the beautiful queen of old Helvetia, who spun from
a distaff fastened to the saddle of her betasseled
palfrey.</p>
<p>But even such a curiosity as Miss Bumps may
have been in the early days of her portable residence
and ever-present tatting grows ordinary when
besieged by Time, and Wyoming no longer regarded
her as a phenomenon. She was just plain
Martha Bumps, to whom many a rural community
owed much. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that
her singular customs of living were considered most
eccentric by strangers who often laughed long and
uproariously at the portable house. Three amused
Vigilantes found in her the best theme material
imaginable, and on the day when Mr. Crusoe reported
having passed her house and her on the
road from Elk Creek, they hastened with their
hostess to the mail-box, ostensibly to await the postman,
but really to see Miss Martha Bumps pass by.</p>
<p>They did not have long to wait. The Willow
Creek trustee had used his best team of horses in
the transportation, and Miss Bumps&#8217; entry into Bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
Canyon was a triumphal one. At a brisk trot and
in a cloud of dust, the equipage came down the easy
grade toward the mail-box and the four interested
Vigilantes, who, throwing aside all ostentation,
sprang to their feet and stared. They saw a little,
blue-ginghamed woman under a huge peanut-straw
hat, who sat in her own front doorway beside a
substantial trustee and tatted while her interested
eyes scanned her chosen country. Spying the four
wayside spectators and doubtless mistaking them
for members of her future flock, she smiled from
behind a pair of gold-bowed spectacles, and waved
a welcoming tatting-shuttle.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks I&#8217;m one of the children,&#8221; said the
former Bear Canyon school-mistress. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t
recognize me as a professional friend. But I&#8217;m
going to call upon her to-morrow if it&#8217;s the last
thing I do while I&#8217;m in Wyoming. Maybe, since
I know the Bear Canyon school, I&#8217;ll even dare give
her some suggestions. I&#8217;m so anxious she should
understand Allan.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mary&#8217;s call was never made, for an hour later
Mr. Benjamin Jarvis rode in to announce with an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
air of mystery a barn-warming in his new building
for that very evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s short notice,&#8221; he explained to those who
had met his invitation with instantaneous and delighted
acceptance, &#8220;it&#8217;s short notice, but, when you
come to think of it, there ain&#8217;t much time left. You
ladies go back East in less than a week, and the
threshers may come any day, so I says to Allan this
mornin&#8217; that seein&#8217; the floor was laid we hadn&#8217;t
better wait to get the windows in nor any finishin&#8217;
touches. It will be a farewell party from Bear
Canyon to you, Miss Mary, and a welcomin&#8217; one
to the new teacher. I just rode past the school-house
to see how she felt about to-night before invitin&#8217;
the others. She&#8217;s all set up an&#8217; settled in the
pine grove next the school, ain&#8217;t tired a mite, and
says there&#8217;s nothing like a neighborhood party to
get a person acquainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary repeated her appreciation as the second
trustee, having announced the time of assembling
and probable other guests, turned his horse&#8217;s head
homeward. Nor were the others slow to voice their
own. Virginia was radiant. A real Wyoming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
barn-warming, she told Mr. Jarvis, seemed the final joy
in their collection of summer treasures, and she
could not be grateful enough for his hospitality
toward her guests.</p>
<p>Everybody for miles around would be there, she
announced that evening as they hurried from supper
to dress. All the people in the Canyon and the
Valley, and even the forest rangers from Sagebrush
Point and Cinnamon Creek. It would not be
much like a Gordon dance or one at St. Helen&#8217;s,
but she knew they would enjoy it. Yes, she said
in response to Priscilla&#8217;s questions, it might really
be quite like the one in <i>The Virginian</i> where they
had swapped the babies.</p>
<p>Vivian, who had been burrowing in her closet
for a stray blue satin slipper to match the gown
spread upon her bed, was surprised a few moments
later to see Virginia&#8217;s dismayed face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Vivian, dear,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d
understand about dressing. You really can&#8217;t wear
that, you know. Why, nobody will be dressed up
like that! It&#8217;s for everybody, you see&mdash;Dick and
Mr. Crusoe and William and the men at Keiths&#8217;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
They&#8217;ll all come in flannel shirts and chaps, and
they&#8217;d all feel so queer and awkward if we dressed
as we would at school. A clean middy is what you
want. I&#8217;m going to wear that. You see, it&#8217;s so
different out here, Vivian.&#8221;</p>
<p>It certainly was different out there, Vivian said
to herself a little petulantly as she hung up the
blue dress, and selected a fresh middy and some
lighter shoes. Would she be expected to dance
with the Bear Canyon forest ranger and his brethren
from Cinnamon Creek and Sagebrush Point&mdash;with
Dick and William and Mr. Crusoe? They were picturesque,
and she would enjoy describing them as
characteristic of the West when she returned home,
but as for dancing with them, that&mdash;she was careful
not to admit to the others&mdash;was quite another
matter.</p>
<p>By seven they were off, Mr. Crusoe being the
proud driver of the large rig, and the other men
following on horseback. The Keith family with
Carver and Jack joined them at the main road, and
all together they journeyed up Bear Canyon which
was populated beyond its wont with pedestrians
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
and equestrians, all bound for the barn-warming of
Mr. Benjamin Jarvis.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s prophecy was fulfilled. <i>Everybody
was there!</i> Not a family in the Valley or Canyon
had missed this opportunity. Babies, securely bundled
against the night air, slumbered on fresh hay
in the unused bins, and allowed their tired parents
a few moments to greet their neighbors. Love for
their old teacher, and interest in their new, divided
the hearts of every child but two in the Bear Canyon
school, those of the little girl in the pink apron
and Allan Jarvis being immovably anchored. The
rangers from Bear Canyon and Sagebrush, together
with a bran-new man from Cinnamon Creek, were
among the guests, and two cow boys from the great
Biering ranch westward had, at the invitation of
Mr. Benjamin Jarvis, driven their bunch of cattle
into his corral, made camp on the nearby hillside,
and stayed for the celebration.</p>
<p>The two guests of honor were escorted to seats
on the center platform, expressly built for Mr. Samuel
Wilson&#8217;s phonograph, which by elevation, it was
believed, would furnish sufficient volume for dancing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
In the few intervals between the quickly succeeding
introductions, Bear Canyon&#8217;s two school-mistresses
began their acquaintanceship, and Mary
found herself strangely fascinated by plain Miss
Martha Bumps. A critical analysis failed to warrant
the fascination. Certainly Miss Bumps&#8217; appearance
was not engrossing. To her, clothes were
an economical and a social necessity. She wore her
traveling gown of faded blue gingham, which of
itself was inconspicuous, had it not been for two
pockets of newer material on either side of the
front. These proofs of unheeded Scriptural warning,
being far different in size, gave the entire garment
a sinister, cross-eyed effect, which did not fail
to catch the eye of the most casual observer. After
a surreptitious examination of the aforesaid pockets,
Mary discovered that one was occupied by Miss
Bumps&#8217; ample handkerchief, and the other by her
tatting.</p>
<p>Nor was there anything extraordinary in the
features of her successor. Ordinary gray hair
was parted most punctiliously upon a most ordinary
forehead. Her eyes were the usual blue, and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
nose a trifle better shaped than the average. In
vain Mary searched for the hiding-place of the fascination
which years afterward she was to understand&mdash;that
fascination which is born of noblest
enthusiasm and a passion for service, and which
can transform all the Valleys of Baca in the wide
world.</p>
<p>Priscilla stood with Virginia and Donald, and
with eyes full of eagerness watched the gathering
of Mr. Benjamin Jarvis&#8217; guests. She longed for
Miss King and Miss Wallace and Dorothy and the
Blackmore Twins&mdash;yes, she even longed for her
mother, in spite of her apprehension lest her Bostonian
mother might not strictly appreciate this
Wyoming barn-warming and the cosmopolitan society
attendant thereupon. She wanted them all to
feel as six weeks ago she had felt that indescribable
<i>first</i> thrill at the sight of chaps and lariats and
fully-equipped cowboys. She wanted them all to
realize that here in Mr. Benjamin Jarvis&#8217; new barn
was a true democracy of comradeship&mdash;a comradeship
freed from the obnoxious fetters of ball-room
etiquette.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>It was the interest sparkling in her brown eyes
which made the Cinnamon Creek forest ranger outdistance
Carver Standish III in his haste to ask
her for the grand march. Carver, in white trousers
and an air a little too pronounced to be termed self-possession,
was leisurely crossing the floor toward
her when his chap-clad rival of Cinnamon Creek
slid past him unceremoniously and reached Priscilla
first. Even then Carver could not believe she
would choose a forest ranger in place of him; and
his anger was by no means cooled when he heard
her say as though in answer to an apology:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you see I can dance with Carver any
day, and I&#8217;ve never danced with a forest ranger in
my life. I was just hoping you&#8217;d ask me when
you came!&#8221;</p>
<p>Baffled, Carver sought Vivian in the corner
whence he had come. Weak as Vivian was at
times, he said to himself, in the matter of associates
she showed better judgment than some other
girls he might name. Vivian did not turn him
down. Secretly she was devoutly thankful he had
rescued her from a persistent Biering cow boy to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
whom she had not been introduced, and with whom,
had an introduction been procured, she did not care
to dance. Before Carver had come, she had
watched Mary talking with that freakish Miss
Bumps, Priscilla chatting with a dozen different
ranchmen, cow boys, and Bear Canyon children, and
Virginia attending to the needs of a fretful baby
while its mother went cookie-hunting to the family
rig.</p>
<p>In her heart of hearts Vivian envied them all.
Inwardly she longed to be one with whom all others
felt at ease; but outwardly it was far easier
to echo Carver&#8217;s vindictive mood, and agree with
him, as they went to take their places in the ever-lengthening
line, that never in her life had she seen
such people.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Wilson with Miss Bumps as a partner
and Mr. Benjamin Jarvis with Mary led the
march, which three times made the circle of the
new barn before breaking into an hilarious two-step.
Mr. Samuel Wilson&#8217;s phonograph groaned
and wheezed bravely from its platform; three great
bon-fires outside made the great barn glow with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
light; the babies in the straw-filled bins slumbered on
while their fathers and mothers grew young again.</p>
<p>Carver, scorning a two-step, was teaching Vivian
a new dance introduced at Gordon the winter before.
Pretty as it was, it was strangely inappropriate
in Mr. Benjamin Jarvis&#8217; barn, and served to
separate Carver and Vivian still farther from their
fellow guests. The Cinnamon Creek forest ranger
watched them until the straight line between his
eyebrows grew deeper and deeper. Then he left
Miss Martha Bumps with the excuse of bringing
her a glass of cider, and started across the floor.
It was too bad, he was thinking to himself, for a
likeable chap like that young Standish to get in bad.
A good-natured word might give him a hint, and
no one be the wiser.</p>
<p>Carver and Vivian did not notice his approach.
They were resting from their dance, and talking together
in tones low yet perfectly audible to one who
might be passing by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such queer people in your life?&#8221;
the tall ranger heard Vivian say, and Carver&#8217;s rejoinder
made the straight line between his brows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
even deeper than before. Apparently there was
double need for his friendly hint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some five hundred, <i>believe me</i>!&#8221; said the third
Carver Standish.</p>
<p>The scorn in his voice was born of petulance
rather than of snobbishness, but no such kindly
discrimination would be made by any sharp-eared
guest of Mr. Benjamin Jarvis, and the Cinnamon
Creek forest ranger lost no time.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you,&#8221; he said frankly but pleasantly
to the amazed Carver Standish, &#8220;I&#8217;d be a bit more
careful about what I said. You see, here in Wyoming
it&#8217;s not considered good form to talk about
your host and his guests. If they heard you, it
mightn&#8217;t be comfortable. And, besides, it seems
to me it would be better to dance with other folks.
That&#8217;s why I came to ask you if you&#8217;d dance the
next dance with me, Miss Winters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carver and Vivian were too discomfited to be
gracious. Like many persons more mature than
they, they sought to cover embarrassment and to
gain control of the situation by bad manners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think,&#8221; said Carver Standish III stiffly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
&#8220;that I need any coaching on behavior from you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And before the ranger had time to reply, had he
contemplated such action, Vivian was ready with
her self-defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather guess New Englanders have about as
good manners as Wyoming people,&#8221; she said scathingly,
&#8220;at least judging from those I&#8217;ve seen!&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply of the Cinnamon Creek forest ranger
was brief and to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always thought so myself until to-night,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>Then he bowed politely, procured a glass of cider
for the waiting Miss Bumps, who was tatting during
the interval, and quietly took his leave. But
his words, angrily received though they had been,
bore fruit, for Carver Standish III danced not only
with Miss Martha Bumps but also with Mrs. Samuel
Wilson who was twice his size; and Vivian,
heartily ashamed of herself and seeking redemption
in her own eyes, accepted the Biering cow boy without
a show of an introduction, and danced with him
three times during the evening, not to mention her
hearty acceptance of Dick and Alec and Joe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>It was late when Mr. Benjamin Jarvis&#8217; barn-warming
broke up, and later when the guests rode
and drove away down the canyon. In Mr. Crusoe&#8217;s
rig, save from one occupant, conversation
and laughter never ceased until they turned down
the avenue of cottonwoods. The Cinnamon Creek
forest ranger came in for his share of the observations
from all but Vivian&mdash;his general superiority
over the other rangers, his good English, the interesting
line between his eyes, and his air of having
seen the world. Miss Bumps was admired and
complimented. The stature of the biggest Biering
cow boy brought forth exclamations. The capacity
of Mr. Benjamin Jarvis as a host received loud
praise. In short, no one was omitted, even to the
youngest Wilson baby, who had looked so adorable
as he lay asleep in the bin.</p>
<p>It had been a memorable evening, Aunt Nan said,
as they gathered around the big fire which Hannah
had kept for them, for a last half hour before
bed-time. She thought they all needed just such
an occasion, so that they might carry back home
with them a knowledge of real Wyoming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
hospitality which knew no strangers. Of course, they
had seen it all summer long, she added, smiling at
Virginia, but the courtesy of Mr. Benjamin Jarvis
had made them one with all Elk Creek Valley and
Bear Canyon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking all the evening of the little
poem we learned last Christmas, Virginia,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You know, the one about the fire. I guess the
big bon-fires at Mr. Jarvis&#8217; made me think of it,
and now this one at home brings it back again.
You remember it, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia did remember. She repeated it softly
while they watched the flames and listened. Vivian,
in her corner, was glad no one could see the red
which crept into her cheeks.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the people out here do,&#8221; said Aunt
Nan after a little when Virginia had finished.
&#8220;They&#8217;re not afraid to give back the &#8216;love and
laughter&#8217; which Life has given them. I think we
reserved New Englanders can learn a lesson from
Mr. Jarvis and the Cinnamon Creek forest ranger
and all the other people we met and be more
willing to give back what we&#8217;ve had given to
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long hour after she had gone to bed Vivian
remembered the lesson she might have learned from
the Cinnamon Creek forest ranger and would not;
the love and laughter she might have given the guests
of Mr. Benjamin Jarvis and did not. Thoroughly
disgusted with herself, she lay looking through the
tent opening at the mountains&mdash;great, silent souls
beneath the stars. They gave back&mdash;just <i>everything</i>,
she thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you sleep, Vivian?&#8221; Virginia whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
from her bed across the tent. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian told half the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that poem,&#8221; she said petulantly. &#8220;Of course
it&#8217;s lovely, but I can&#8217;t get it out of my mind, and
I hate to have things run through my head like
that!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE CINNAMON CREEK FOREST RANGER</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;No, Vivian,&#8221; assured Virginia for at least the
tenth time, &#8220;there aren&#8217;t any cattle on those hills.
You just turn up the Bear Canyon road where we
went after the bear, and go till you reach the creek.
It&#8217;s only a mile from here. Then if you feel a
bit nervous about riding Siwash up the mountain,
why tie him to a tree and walk. Perhaps &#8217;twill be
easier anyway, for you&#8217;ll find the kinnikinnick just
after you leave the creek. It will be redder in
the open places, so hunt for those. You&#8217;ll love it
for Christmas boxes. If it weren&#8217;t for Cæsar, I&#8217;d
go with you, but I want to finish the third book
before Mary goes. Is it at the creek Carver&#8217;s going
to meet you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There or at the crossroads,&#8221; explained Vivian,
as she mounted Siwash. &#8220;He went to town this
morning with Donald, but he said he&#8217;d be back in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
plenty of time. I tried to &#8217;phone, but I guess there
must be something wrong. I couldn&#8217;t get any one,
and it didn&#8217;t buzz at all. But I know he&#8217;ll be there,
and I&#8217;m not a bit afraid of Siwash. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia stood on the porch and watched Vivian
ride down the lane before returning to Cæsar. She
was wondering if anything could be the matter,
if, perhaps, something had happened at the barn-warming
the evening before to displease Vivian.
She had seemed so unlike herself all the
morning.</p>
<p>But, she concluded wisely, few days were cloudless,
and even an almost perfect house-party had
its ups and downs. She and Donald had both
discovered that. So many different personalities
were bound to collide occasionally, and one couldn&#8217;t
be happy always. An afternoon on the mountain
was sure to make Vivian&#8217;s world bright again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Vivian neared the crossroads. Carver
was not there. A scanning of the prairie showed
him nowhere in sight. She would ride up the
canyon to the ford and wait there, she said to
herself. When she rode, her thoughts were less
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
troublesome, and it was far easier to stick to her
resolve.</p>
<p>Last evening, just as Mr. Benjamin Jarvis&#8217; guests
were dispersing, she had made a hasty engagement
with Carver to meet her the following afternoon
and go for kinnikinnick up Cinnamon Creek. The
search for kinnikinnick was not, however, her real
reason for wishing to see Carver. If her courage
did not fail her, and if her sudden resolve did
not wane in the light of day, as resolves so often
do, she was going to ask Carver to ride with her
up Cinnamon Creek to the ranger&#8217;s cabin, and there
help her to apologize for their rudeness. To admit
her regret to Carver would be even more difficult
than to apologize to the ranger, and she was not
at all sure that she should wish to do so in severely
practical daylight.</p>
<p>Yet daylight had come&mdash;it was early afternoon
of the next day&mdash;and she was still ready if Carver
would only come. She allowed Siwash to sink
his warm nose in the amber waters of the ford
while she waited. It was very still up there. In
fact, only Virginia&#8217;s repeated assurances that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
were no cattle on the hills and her own knowledge
that a homesteader&#8217;s cabin was just out of sight
beyond the quaking-asps on her left, made Vivian
endure that stillness, broken only by the hurrying
creek waters and the lazy humming of tiny, hidden
insects.</p>
<p>To her right rose the mountain wall, dark with
pine and spruce, though here and there a flaming
service-berry or a hawthorn broke through the evergreens
like sudden fire. The tangle of trees and
shrubs seemed impenetrable, and yet Virginia had
told of a trail which led from the creek not three
rods from the ford&mdash;led up, up, up for five miles
until it reached the Cinnamon Creek Station.</p>
<p>Why did not Carver come? She wished she could
be as patient as Siwash who stood knee deep in
the ford, hung his shaggy, homely head, and stole
a nap gratefully. For the twentieth time Vivian
rehearsed her speeches, the one to Carver and the
other to the insulted ranger. That is, he had every
cause to be insulted, though her memory of the
smile with which he had received her thrust would
seem to dispute his justifiable indignation. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
here in the mountains people were not so easily
insulted. They, the mountains, were so big and
generous that they made one ashamed of littleness.</p>
<p>Being sure of the speeches, she grew more and
more impatient. Carver, waiting in Elk Creek for
a stock train to load up with its living freight,
was even more uneasy than she. He could not leave
Donald and there was no way of letting Vivian
know that he could not meet her at the ford. At
last, having convinced himself that he could not
help matters, he sat down on the station platform,
disturbed in spirit and conscience, and hoped that
Vivian had already turned back home.</p>
<p>But Vivian did not turn back. It grew hot by
the ford, and she decided to tie Siwash in the
shadow of some quaking-asps across the creek, and
go up the trail herself to a shady place. Carver
would see Siwash and call to her if she did not
hear him come.</p>
<p>It was cool and shady beneath the trees that
bordered the rocky trail. She would willingly have
rested had not her eyes spied the red berries of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
some kinnikinnick growing on either side of the
path. Farther away in an open space she saw more
and larger. They were far prettier than holly for
Christmas boxes, and would be so different to her
friends back East. She loved the tiny leaves and
graceful trailing of the vines, which seemed hardly
sturdy enough to hold the big, round, jolly-looking
berries.</p>
<p>Virginia was right. They did grow more luxuriantly
in the infrequent open places, and she climbed
farther and farther up the mountain side, seeking
like Hansel and Gretel for bigger berries than she
had found. Sometimes she stood still and listened.
The silence made a queer catch in her throat. Had
it not been for her eagerness to find more and better
kinnikinnick, and her knowledge that the homesteader&#8217;s
cabin was very near, she would have been
frightened. But Carver must be there very soon,
and though she often left the trail, the sound of the
creek was proof against her being lost. Her own
woodsman instinct was not strong, but Virginia
had told her always to trust the creek, which would
ever lead one down whence she had come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>Once her heart almost stopped beating. Away
in the top of a great spruce she heard a hammering
sound. It echoed through the silent woods like great
blows of an ax, and some long moments passed before
Vivian could assure her frightened heart that
it was only a flicker searching for his dinner.</p>
<p>Her box was filled with kinnikinnick and she
would go back. If Carver were not at the ford,
they must make the trip up the trail the next day in
spite of Virginia&#8217;s plan for a ride to Lone Mountain.
If necessary, she would be brave enough to
explain matters, and then they would understand.</p>
<p>She turned to go down the mountain, when suddenly
from above her came a sound of breaking
underbrush as though some creature were bursting
from its covert. Vivian stood motionless, too
terrified to move or to scream. It was not Carver&mdash;that
was certain. He would never be upon the
mountain. It was far more likely to be a bear.
Why not one here as well as farther up the canyon
where they had caught that monster from the sight
of which she had not yet recovered? Thoughts
passed like flashes through her brain while that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
awful sound of breaking twigs continued. Hundreds
and hundreds of them came, crowding one
another for space&mdash;thoughts of St. Helen&#8217;s, snatches
of poems she had learned, memories of things which
had frightened her as a child. And last of all,
perhaps because without knowing it she had reached
a great tree and sunk in a little heap at its foot,
came the picture of a sallow youth in eye-glasses
and a linen duster, who had once, ages ago, crashed
through some underbrush somewhere else!</p>
<p>The crashing ceased. Some one stepped into the
trail above her. The thought of a bear had somehow
given place to her old knight-errant of the
soda-fountain. And yet when she looked up, expecting
to see his pale, sickly countenance, she saw
instead the khaki-clad form and the surprised blue
eyes of the Cinnamon Creek forest ranger!</p>
<p>He was the very person she had wished to see.
She could make her speech now, and be spared her
long ride, and yet she found herself studying the
line between his eyes and wondering why other
people did not have a line there, too. It was the
Cinnamon Creek forest ranger who spoke first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If that were an oak tree,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d think
you were consulting an oracle; but since it isn&#8217;t,
maybe you&#8217;re just a Dryad who&#8217;s fallen out of the
branches. What are you doing away up here anyway?
I guess you startled me almost as much as
I seem to have startled you. I&#8217;m mighty sorry I
scared you though!&#8221;</p>
<p>His apology made Vivian remember her own,
and though she quite forgot her speech and just
stammered out how sorry she was, the ranger liked
it quite as well and assured her he should never think
of it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since you&#8217;ve come away off
up here, I&#8217;m not going to let you go home until
you&#8217;ve seen my garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your garden?&#8221; queried Vivian. &#8220;Why, your
cabin isn&#8217;t here! It&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he interrupted, &#8220;but my garden is.
Follow me. I&#8217;ll show you. I promise there aren&#8217;t
any bears.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed him for half a mile up the trail.
They wound around great bowlders and along the
edges of steep, forbidding places. Then the ranger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
paused before a thicket of yellow quaking-asps.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the entrance,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Now prepare,
for you&#8217;re going to see something more wonderful
than the hanging gardens of Nineveh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pushing aside the quaking-asps, he made a path
for Vivian, who followed, mystified. A few moments
more and they had passed the portals, and
stood in the ranger&#8217;s garden.</p>
<p>Vivian caught her breath. Never in her life had
she seen such grandeur of color. They stood in
an open place&mdash;a tiny valley surrounded by brown
foot-hills. Beyond, the higher pine-clad mountains
shut off the valley from the eyes of all who did
not seek it. Some great, gray, over-hanging rocks
guarded the farther entrance. Within the inclosure,
carpeting the valley and clothing the foot-hills,
great masses of color glowed in the gold of
the sunlight. The ranger&#8217;s garden was a flaming
pageant of yellow and bronze and orange, crimson
and scarlet and purple between a cloudless, turquoise
sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Vivian. &#8220;It&#8217;s just like a secret, isn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
it, hidden away up here? I never saw such color
in all my life, except in Thaïs, you know, where the
women in Alexandria wore such beautiful gowns.&#8221;
Somehow she knew that the Cinnamon Creek forest
ranger <i>did</i> know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said understandingly, &#8220;I remember,
only this is better than grand opera, because it&#8217;s
real. You see, I spotted this place last spring. I
saw all the different shrubs&mdash;quaking-asp and buck-brush
and Oregon grape and service-berry and
hawthorn and wild currant&mdash;and I thought to myself
that this would be some garden in September.
It&#8217;s cold nights up here in these hills, the frosts
are early, and the sun strikes this valley all day.
It&#8217;s going to be even more gorgeous in two weeks
more. It isn&#8217;t exactly on my beat, but it&#8217;s near
enough so I can make it. Come on. I&#8217;ll show you
all the different things.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he led her from golden quaking-asp to crimson
hawthorn, and taught her the names of everything
that grew in his wonderful garden. Before
they had made the circle, Vivian mustered courage,
and, seeing the jeweled pin upon the pocket of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
rough shirt, which his coat had covered the evening
before, asked him about himself, and if Wyoming
were his home.</p>
<p>No, he said, glad to tell her. He was from Maine,
and the pin he wore was his fraternity pin. He had
studied forestry in the university there, and then,
becoming ill, had been sent West to get rid of a
nasty cough which didn&#8217;t want to go away. But
the mountains had proven the best doctors in the
world, and he was only staying on a year in the
cabin at Cinnamon Creek to learn the mountain
trees, and to add a few more pounds before going
back home again.</p>
<p>Vivian grew more and more confused as she
listened. Here he was a New Englander like herself,
and she had been so rude. What would Carver
say when he knew?</p>
<p>&#8220;It just shows,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that we never can tell
about persons on first acquaintance. I&#8217;m doubly
sorry I was rude last night. I thought you didn&#8217;t
talk like a Westerner, but I didn&#8217;t dream you were
from New England!&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned since I&#8217;ve been out here,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;that it doesn&#8217;t make any difference where we&#8217;re
from. Wyoming hearts are just like New England
ones, and the only safe way is never to be rude
or unkind at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian agreed with him. She never would be
again, she said to herself, as they left the garden
and went back down the trail to Siwash and the
ford. Carver was not there, and the ranger insisted
upon walking home with her. He would not
have stayed for supper had not Virginia and Aunt
Nan, meeting them at the mail-box, persuaded
him.</p>
<p>So it was a very merry party that ate supper
beneath the cottonwoods&mdash;a party saddened only
by the early good-night of the Cinnamon Creek
ranger, who wanted to make his mountain cabin
before darkness quite obliterated the trail. As he
swung into the main road after some cordial handshakes
which warmed his heart, he met Carver
Standish III.</p>
<p>It was too nearly dark for Carver to see the
fraternity pin, and no one had yet told him that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
the ranger was from New England. Nevertheless,
he straightened his shoulders, and held out
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted to see you, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to tell
you that I was an awful cad last night, and that
I&#8217;m dead ashamed of it!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE WINTHROP COAT-OF-ARMS</h3>
</div>

<p>Priscilla, sitting under the biggest cottonwood,
was writing to Miss Wallace, in her best handwriting,
on her best stationery, in her best style. One
unconsciously brought forth the best she had for
Miss Wallace. She was telling of the Emperor and
of the Cinnamon Creek ranger, sure that Miss Wallace
would be glad to add both to her collection
of interesting people. Interruptions were many.
Carver, moody and silent, rode over, looking for
entertainment, and she did her best; Vivian, having
reached a halt in her daily Latin review, asked
assistance; little David, Alec&#8217;s adorable son, had
come over with his mother for the afternoon, and
Priscilla found him irresistible; and at last Donald,
riding homeward, hot and tired from working
on the range, had stopped for rest and refreshment.
With Hannah&#8217;s help Priscilla had provided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
the refreshment, and the ground beneath the cottonwood
was giving the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some stationery!&#8221; said Donald, raising himself
on his elbow to look at the pile of sheets which
Priscilla had placed in readiness on the grass. &#8220;A
shield and an eagle and a lion and a unicorn all
at once, to say nothing of Latin. What does it
say? &#8216;<i>Courage&mdash;my&mdash;&mdash;</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Courage is my heritage</i>,&#8221; translated Priscilla
proudly. &#8220;It&#8217;s our family coat-of-arms, and that&#8217;s
the motto. We&#8217;ve had it for years and years, ever
since the Wars of the Roses. A Winthrop was
shield-bearer for Edward, Duke of York, and
Grandfather used to say we could be traced back
to the Norman Conquest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Donald politely, but with something
very like amusement in his blue eyes. &#8220;You New
England folks are strong on crests and mottoes
and that sort of thing, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than we should be,&#8221; announced Priscilla
a little haughtily. &#8220;We are the oldest families
for the most part, and I think we ought to remember
all those things about our ancestors. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
very&mdash;stimulating. The West is so excited over
progress and developing the country and all that,&#8221;
she finished a little disdainfully, &#8220;that it doesn&#8217;t
care about family traditions or&mdash;or anything like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Donald. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
so bad as that. We think a fine family history is
a splendid thing. I venture I&#8217;m as proud of my
Scotch forefathers as you are of the Duke of York&#8217;s
shield-bearer, though we haven&#8217;t any coat-of-arms,
and never did have any, I guess. Only back there
you think it&#8217;s a necessity to have a good ancestry,
and out here we just consider it a help. I like
what Burns said about a man being just a man.
That&#8217;s the way we feel out here. It isn&#8217;t what you
come from; it&#8217;s what you <i>are</i>, and what you can
do. Family mottoes are all right, if you live up
to them. I knew a fellow at school when I was
East two years ago. He roomed with me. He had
the family coat-of-arms framed and hung on the
wall. &#8217;Twas all red and silver, and the motto was
&#8216;<i>Ne cede malis</i>&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Yield not to difficulties.&#8217; The
funny part was that he was the biggest quitter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
in school. You see, I think it&#8217;s you who have to
uphold the motto&mdash;not the motto that has to uphold
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Priscilla ate a cookie silently. She wished Donald
were not so convincing.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance,&#8221; Donald continued, &#8220;suppose <i>Courage
is my heritage</i> were Vivian&#8217;s family motto. Do
you think that fact would give Vivian an extra
amount of courage if she said it over a thousand
times? I don&#8217;t. All the courage Vivian&#8217;s got she&#8217;s
gained for herself without any motto to help her
out. And I guess that&#8217;s the way with most of us
in this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took his hat and rose to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to be making for home,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Dave&#8217;s gone, and I&#8217;ve an extra amount of work
to do. Thanks awfully for the cookies, and don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m too hard on the family motto business.
I can see where your motto means a heap to you,
but you&#8217;re not a quitter anyway, Priscilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jumped on MacDuff and rode down the lane
with a final wave of his hat as he galloped homeward
across the prairie. Priscilla&#8217;s cheeks grew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
red as she watched him. She was not any too
sure that she was not a quitter. Disturbing memories
came to trouble her&mdash;memories of occasions
when she had not proven the truth of the motto,
which had fired her ancestors. Donald was right,
too, about ancestry and coats-of-arms and mottoes
being only helps. Her New England conscience
told her that, and her weeks in Wyoming corroborated
her conscience. Still she was averse to admitting
it&mdash;even to Donald.</p>
<p>She returned to her unfinished letter, but Genius
seemed on a vacation. She could not picture the
Emperor to Miss Wallace&mdash;could not give the impression
which he had indelibly stamped upon her
memory as he stood between Nero and Trajan at
the palace entrance. The coat-of-arms seemed a
disturbing element. She covered it with a strip of
paper, but still thoughts would not come.</p>
<p>Disgruntled and out-of-sorts, she put away her
letter, and started toward the house. Carver&#8217;s
mood was contagious, she said to herself. In Hannah&#8217;s
kitchen she found Mrs. Alec and little David,
a roly-poly youngster of three who demanded too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
much attention for just one mother. Priscilla, seeing
in David a sure antidote for introspection, offered
to play the part of the necessary other mother,
and took him out-of-doors, much to the relief of
tired Mrs. Alec. She had no more time to think
of family mottoes or coats-of-arms. David clamored
for attention, begged to be shown the horse,
the dogs, and all the live-stock which the ranch
afforded. Priscilla was an obedient guide. Nothing
was omitted from the itinerary. When David,
satisfied as to the other four-footed possessions,
said &#8220;Pigs&#8221; in his funny Scotch way, pigs it was!</p>
<p>She led him down the hill to the corral, then
off toward the right where the pigs had their
abiding-place. A pile of rocks, the crevices of
which were filled with all weeds infesting the neighborhood
of pigs, offered a vantage-ground from
which they might view the landscape so alluring
to little David. With his hand in hers, she was
helping him mount the rocks one by one.</p>
<p>Suddenly a miniature saw-mill whirred at their
feet. A swarm of bees filled the air! Priscilla,
intent upon David, had not noticed the flat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
surface of the rock where the sun lay warm and bright.
Warned by the strange sound, her terrified eyes saw
the snake, coiled and ready to spring! She had
a fleeting vision of a flat, cruel head, and a thousand
diamond-shaped yellow dots as she grasped
little David by the neckband and pulled him from
the rocks to the corral. It was a rattlesnake! The
brakeman&#8217;s prophecy had come true! In spite of
Virginia&#8217;s assertion that they never came near the
house, she had seen one!</p>
<p>Little David was crying from surprise and a sore
neck. He had not seen the snake. Priscilla was
trembling in every muscle. There was no one whom
she could call. The men were on the range and
in the fields; Mr. Hunter and the girls, except
Vivian, were in town; Aunt Nan was at the Keiths.
The snake must not be allowed to live. Little
David might be playing around there again, or some
other child. She herself would never, never have
the courage&mdash;&mdash;! She started, for suddenly in place
of the sound of the saw-mill and the vision of the
diamond-shaped dots, came the memory of a lion
rampant on a field of gold, an eagle perched upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
a shield, and a unicorn surrounded by stars. As
the red came back into her white cheeks, Donald&#8217;s
words came back also:</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, you&#8217;re no quitter anyway, Priscilla!&#8221;</p>
<p>Two minutes later Mrs. Alec and Hannah were
surprised to receive into their midst a shrieking
child, borne by a most determined girl, who was
almost out of breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Except his neck,
I mean! I dragged him. I had to! I&#8217;ll tell you
why by and by. Keep him till I get back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she flew out of the house and down the
path to the stables. A many-tined pitchfork rested
against one of the sheds. It was one which William
had used that morning in turning over sod
for a new flower-bed. Priscilla in her hurried transit
with David had marked the fork, and chosen
it as her best weapon. Of all those cruel tines,
one must surely be successful. Donald had told
tales of forked sticks and heavy stones, but her
hands were too inexperienced for those things.</p>
<p>She seized the fork and ran down the path toward
the rocks, not daring to stop lest her resolve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
should fail her; not even waiting to plan her attack
lest the memory of that awful head should
send her back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>The saw-mill whirred again as she neared the
rock. Apparently the snake had not stirred since
his last conquest. This time she saw his wicked
little eyes, his flattened head, and the contraction
of his diamond-covered muscles as he made ready
to spring. But Priscilla sprang first. The tines
of the heavy pitchfork pierced the coils, and the
only whirr which sounded was the whirr of iron
against the rock.</p>
<p>Priscilla, on the rock below, held the handle of
the pitchfork firmly, and tried not to look at her
victim as he writhed in agony. A sickness was
creeping over her. There were queer vibrations in
the air, and a strange, singing sound in her ears.
Memory brought back the picture of an evening
in Carver Standish&#8217;s room at the Gordon School
when she had felt the same way. She would not
faint, she said to herself, rallying all her forces.
She would die first! The snake had ceased writhing.
He was surely dead. Little David need be no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
longer in danger, and she&mdash;perhaps she need not
feel so unworthy when she thought of the Winthrop
coat-of-arms.</p>
<p>She was very white when she reached the kitchen
after depositing the pitchfork and its burden by
the shed. Grateful Mrs. Alec cried and held little
David closer when Priscilla, fortified by Hannah&#8217;s
cider, told the story. Alec, who came in a few minutes
later, was grateful, too, in his bluff Scotch
way. The snake, he said, was a whopper. He had
rarely seen a larger, and Miss Priscilla was a trump&mdash;the
very bravest tenderfoot he&#8217;d ever seen!</p>
<p>She had been true to her heritage, Donald said
that evening&mdash;worthy to bear the Winthrop coat-of-arms.
But then he knew she wasn&#8217;t a quitter anyway.
He had told her so that very afternoon.</p>
<p>But Priscilla&#8217;s honesty was equal to all the demands
placed upon it that night. Donald&#8217;s praise
was but the last straw!</p>
<p>&#8220;All the coats-of-arms and family mottoes in the
world, Donald,&#8221; she said, &#8220;couldn&#8217;t have made me
kill that snake. It was what you said about them,
and about me not being a quitter that did it. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
think I was a quitter until this afternoon; but now
I can go and write Miss Wallace without covering
up the top of the paper. I&#8217;m going to do it before
bed-time, if you&#8217;ll excuse me. Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A GOOD SPORT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; sighed Vivian, shifting her position
in the saddle for the tenth time in as many minutes,
and taking off her broad-brimmed hat to fan
her tanned, flushed face. &#8220;I think sagebrush must
attract the sun. I never was hotter in all my life!
I wish now we&#8217;d stayed at the Buffalo Horn and
waited till after supper to start back. Of course I
don&#8217;t exactly love riding in the dark, but of the
two I&#8217;d about as soon be scared to death as baked.
Where is the next shady spot, Virginia? I can&#8217;t
see a tree for miles! I honestly can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any,&#8221; said the comforting Virginia,
brushing back the damp rings of hair from her
hot forehead, &#8220;and the next shady spot is two miles
away. The trail bends and there are some quaking-asps
by a spring. We&#8217;ll rest there, and eat our
cookies, and drink some real water. &#8217;Twill be a
change from the river.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful for the river though, even if I
have drunk all kinds of bugs. I guess we&#8217;d have
died without it through all these miles of sagebrush.
When will the others get home, do you
suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until late,&#8221; Virginia answered, &#8220;that is, if
they wait for supper. I&#8217;d have loved to have stayed,
but William wants Pedro for the range to-morrow,
and I wanted him to have a longer rest. Besides,
he runs so with the other horses and gets nervous.
You were a peach to come with me, Vivian. Right
in the hottest part of the day, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian was honest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t all out of kindness,&#8221; she admitted,
&#8220;though, of course, I love to ride with you. I didn&#8217;t
especially care about riding home at night, and I
don&#8217;t like such a big crowd either. Siwash always
forgets how old he is, and begins to act kittenish,
and I never know what to do. I&#8217;m thirsty again.
Shall we drink a few more bugs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might as well, I suppose,&#8221; Virginia replied.
&#8220;Pedro and Siwash seem ready. Ugh! I got
one that time! Actually felt him go down my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
throat! We ought not to put water on our faces,
Vivian. They&#8217;re peeling now! Here&#8217;s some cold
cream!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian squeezed the tube and smeared her glowing
nose, before she again mounted Siwash.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t drink any more of the river,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I feel like an insect cabinet already. Let&#8217;s
get to the quaking-asps as soon as we can and
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s eyes glowed with pride as she watched
Vivian mount Siwash and ride away from the
river. One would never have known it was the
same Vivian who nearly seven weeks ago had
begged to stay at home from the getting-acquainted
trip. She had learned to ride well and easily, and
no apparent fear, at least of Siwash, remained.
With still more pride Virginia saw her tanned,
happy face, the red color in her cheeks, and the
extra pounds which Wyoming had given her. The
Big Horn country had been kind to Vivian in more
ways than one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw any one improve so in riding,
Vivian,&#8221; she could not resist saying. &#8220;You do every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
bit as well as Priscilla, and Don thinks she&#8217;s a marvel.
I&#8217;m proud as Punch of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian&#8217;s cheeks glowed redder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help but be a tiny bit pleased with myself,&#8221;
she said hesitatingly, &#8220;at least about the riding.
And&mdash;and there are other things, too, Virginia.
Of course I know there have been loads
of silly things&mdash;Mr. Crusoe, for instance. I&#8217;ll never
forget how awful that was, even though you were
all so fine about it. But in spite of everything
foolish, I have learned things out here, Virginia,
that I never knew in all my life. Mother and Father
probably won&#8217;t see any difference next week
when I get home, but there is some just the same.
I&#8217;m not quite such a&mdash;a coward as I was! I feel
it inside!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you do,&#8221; said Virginia, riding Pedro
closer. &#8220;It shows on your face, too. I guess what&#8217;s
really inside of us usually does. You&#8217;re getting to
be a good sport, Vivian, and we&#8217;re all proud of it&mdash;with
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The knowledge of Virginia&#8217;s approval somehow
made the mid-day heat less intense, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the two miles to the quaking-asps less long. It
was good to reach them, and to lie at full
length on the cool ground before drinking from
the spring a few steps away. Pedro and
Siwash were grateful, too, as they cropped the
sweet, moist grass. A half hour here would sustain
them against the three miles of sagebrush beyond.</p>
<p>Virginia and Vivian lay flat on their backs with
their arms straight above their heads and rested,
as they had been taught to do at St. Helen&#8217;s. Above
them the interlaced branches of the quaking-asps
shut out the sun. The air was still with that strange
stillness which sometimes comes before a storm.
Even the ever-active leaves of the quaking-asps
moved not at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the stillest place I ever knew,&#8221; said Vivian,
as she reached for a cookie. &#8220;How far is it to the
nearest house?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia considered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six miles,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No, there&#8217;s a homesteader&#8217;s
cabin nearer. That&#8217;s about four, I guess,
but Michner&#8217;s, the cattle ranch, is six. We always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
call them the nearest neighbors from here. It is
still, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awfully!&#8221; returned Vivian.</p>
<p>Their words were hardly finished when the sound
of hoofs broke the stillness. Pedro and Siwash
snorted. Virginia and Vivian sat up quickly&mdash;one
interested, the other alarmed. Some one was coming
along the rough trail through the sagebrush.
Some one was very near! They peered through
the quaking-asps. The some one was a lone cowboy
riding a buckskin horse. He was leaning forward
in his saddle and clutching the horn. His
face, almost covered by the big hat he wore, was
close to the black mane of the sturdy little buckskin.</p>
<p>From their shelter they watched him draw near
with beating hearts. There was something strange
about him&mdash;strange as the stillness. They could
not see that he was guiding the horse, who apparently
knew not only the way, but her mission as
well. She came straight toward the shady thicket
and stopped beneath the trees a few rods away
from the two anxious spectators. Her rider, conscious
perhaps from the halt that he had reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
his destination, loosened his hold upon the saddle-horn,
swung himself with a mighty effort from
the saddle, and fell upon the ground, his hat all
unnoticed falling from his head.</p>
<p>The buckskin was apparently worried. She
sniffed the air dubiously, snorted an anxious greeting
to Pedro and Siwash, and moved to one side,
lest by mistake she should tread upon her master,
who lay in a motionless heap close beside her. Then
Virginia&#8217;s quick eyes discovered blood upon the
man&#8217;s head and face. She jumped to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hurt somehow, Vivian,&#8221; she said, &#8220;terribly
hurt, I&#8217;m afraid. We mustn&#8217;t leave him like
this. He might die here all alone! Come on! Let&#8217;s
see what we can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian, too surprised to remonstrate, followed
Virginia through the quaking-asps. The man lay
where he had fallen, unconscious of anything about
him. Blood was flowing from an ugly wound just
above his forehead. He was a sad and sorry sight.
Vivian shuddered and drew back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he, Virginia?&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;You
know who he is, don&#8217;t you? Oh, what are you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
going to do?&#8221; For Virginia&#8217;s strong young
arms were trying to pull the man into a more
comfortable position, and farther beneath the
trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know who he is,&#8221; she whispered,
fanning the man&#8217;s white face with her broad-brimmed
hat. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make any difference.
He&#8217;s awfully hurt! I thought at first &#8217;twas a shot,
but I guess he&#8217;s fallen. It looks like that. The
horse belongs to Michner&#8217;s. I know by the brand.
Fan him, Vivian, while I fix his head and see if
he has any whisky about him anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dazed and frightened Vivian obediently took
the fan, and turning her face away, frantically
fanned the quaking-asps until they danced and fluttered
once more. Virginia untied the cow boy&#8217;s
slicker from the back of the buckskin&#8217;s saddle and
folded it into a pillow, which she placed beneath
the sick man&#8217;s head. The buckskin was relieved and
whinnied her thanks. Then from one pocket she
drew a small, leathern flask and shook it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Empty!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Hard luck! Water will
have to do. We were careless to forget our drinking-cups.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
Rinse this flask, and get some water from
the spring, Vivian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian, still waving the fan in the air, brought
the water, which Virginia tried to pour between
the man&#8217;s lips. It seemed to arouse him, for he
drank some gratefully, though without opening his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to wash some of this blood away,&#8221; said
Virginia, &#8220;but I guess I won&#8217;t take the time. You
can do that after I&#8217;m gone. There&#8217;s only one thing
to do. We can&#8217;t leave this man here in this condition.
He might die before any one found him.
I&#8217;ll take Pedro and ride on to Michner&#8217;s as fast
as I can for help. Or,&#8221; she added, seeing Vivian&#8217;s
eyes open wider, &#8220;<i>you</i> take him, and I&#8217;ll stay here.
Either you like, only we must decide at once.
Maybe we&#8217;ll meet somebody or somebody&#8217;ll come,
or maybe there&#8217;ll be somebody at the homesteader&#8217;s
cabin. Which will you do, ride or stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian had decided before she looked at Pedro.
She always felt that Pedro entertained scorn for
her, contempt that wild gallops through the sagebrush
should, together with his youth and speed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
present terrors. She knew that he despised her for
preferring Siwash to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; she said firmly. &#8220;Pedro will do more
for you than for me. When will you be back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia was already in the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably in little more than an hour, if I find
folks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Keep giving him some water if
he needs it, and fan him. He may come to.
Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of Pedro&#8217;s feet died away all too
quickly. The stillness which followed was deeper
than ever. It fairly sang in the air. For fully five
minutes Vivian stood motionless, loath to believe
that Virginia had gone. She did not want to be
alone! Something inside of her cried out against
it. But she <i>was</i> alone&mdash;she, Vivian Winters, alone
with a dying cow boy on a limitless Wyoming plain.
Since the relentless knowledge pushed itself upon
her, she might as well accept it. <i>She was alone!</i>
And there was the cow boy!</p>
<p>Virginia had said that he might come to! For
her own sake she hoped he didn&#8217;t. He was awful
enough as he was&mdash;blood-smeared and dirty&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
at least he did not realize the situation, and that was
a scant comfort. If he came to, he might be insane.
Blows on the head often made persons so.
Given insanity and a gun, what would be the
demonstration?</p>
<p>A low groan from the quaking-asp thicket brought
Vivian to herself. Imagination had no place here.
This man was hurt, and she was strong and well.
There was a spring of water near by, and she had
extra handkerchiefs in her pocket. It was plainly
up to her!</p>
<p>The stillness was less persistent after she had
gone to the spring for water. She forgot all about
it as she knelt beside the wounded man and washed
the blood from his pain-distorted face. He opened
his eyes as he felt the cold cloths, and Vivian saw
that they were good, blue eyes. They, together with
the absence of blood and dirt, told her that her patient
was young&mdash;only a boy, in fact! The cut
on his head was ugly! Something fluttered inside
of her as she parted his hair to place a clean handkerchief
upon it, and for a moment she was ill and
faint. The cow boy&#8217;s &#8220;Thank you, miss,&#8221; brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
her to herself. Perhaps he was coming to! It was
not so awful as she had thought.</p>
<p>But he again fell asleep, cleaner and more comfortable
than before. The buckskin whinnied her
thanks, and put her nose against Vivian&#8217;s arm as
she went to the spring for more water. For the
first time in her life Vivian felt the comradeship,
the dumb understanding of a horse. Then Siwash
became glorified. He was something more than a
ragged, decrepit old pony. He was a companion,
and Vivian stopped to pat him before she hurried
back to her patient.</p>
<p>Upon her return from her third journey after
water, she found the cow boy&#8217;s eyes again open.
This time he had raised himself on his elbow and
was looking at her. He had come to, and it was
not horrible at all. Her only feeling was one of
alarm lest his sitting up should cause his wound to
bleed again, and she hurried to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re feeling better, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she faltered.
&#8220;But you&#8217;d better lie down. You&#8217;ve got a pretty
bad cut on your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy smiled in a puzzled way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to remember much,&#8221; he said, &#8220;except
the header. My horse fell when I wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
expectin&#8217; it, and I went on a rock. &#8217;Twas the only
one on the prairie, I guess, but it got me for sure.
What are you doin&#8217; here, miss? I don&#8217;t seem to
remember you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivian explained as simply as possible. She and
her friend had been resting when his horse brought
him to the quaking-asps. One of them had gone
for help, and the other had stayed. She was the
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not from these parts, I take it,&#8221; said the
boy, still puzzled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t speak like us folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Vivian told him, &#8220;I&#8217;m from the East. I
came out here six weeks ago to visit my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her patient looked surprised and raised himself
again on his elbow in spite of Vivian&#8217;s restraining
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much of a tenderfoot as that?&#8221; he said, gazing
at her. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t usually such good sports
as you are, miss. Yes, thank you, I&#8217;ll have some
more water. It&#8217;s right good, I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he fell asleep again, and left Vivian to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
companionship of Siwash and the buckskin. Her
patient comfortable, she fed them the remaining
cookies, wondering as she did so where the awful
sense of loneliness had gone. She should welcome
Virginia&mdash;already it was time for her&mdash;but the
knowledge that she must stay another hour would
not present such terrors to her.</p>
<p>It was Siwash who first caught the sound of returning
hoofs&mdash;Siwash and the relieved buckskin.
They neighed and told Vivian, who ran from the
thicket to see if they were right. Yes, there was
Virginia, with Pedro still in the lead, and two men
on horseback behind her. She had luckily met them
a mile this side of Michner&#8217;s, and hurried them back
with her. The cow boy had again raised himself,
as they rode up to him and dismounted. He was
better, for he could look sheepish! This being
thrown from one&#8217;s horse was a foolish thing!</p>
<p>They would stay with him, the men said. They
knew him well. He was called &#8220;Scrapes&#8221; at Michner&#8217;s
because he was always getting into trouble.
This last was the worst yet. They would camp there
that night, and in the morning he could ride home,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
they felt sure. They were grateful to the girls.
Scrapes was a likeable chap, and no one wanted
him hurt.</p>
<p>But Scrapes himself was the most grateful. He
staggered to his feet as Vivian went up to tell him
good-by and shook hands with her, and then with
Virginia. But his eyes were for Vivian.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the best tenderfoot I ever knew, miss,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You was sure some good sport to take
care o&#8217; me. Would you take my quirt? It&#8217;s bran
new, and I made it all myself. Get it off my horn,
Jim. Yes, I want you to have it. Good-by!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scrapes is right,&#8221; said Virginia, as they left the
thicket and started homeward. &#8220;I said a while ago
that you were getting to be one, Vivian, but now
I know you&#8217;ve got there&mdash;for sure!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>CARVER STANDISH III FITS IN</h3>
</div>

<p>Carver Standish III hated the world, himself,
and everybody else&mdash;at least, he thought he did. In
fact, he had been so sure of it all day that no one
had attempted any argument on the subject. Jack,
unable to maneuver a fishing-trip and secretly glad
of an escape, had ridden over to Mary with some
much-needed mending; Donald had been glad to ride
on the range on an errand for his father; Mr. Keith
was in town; the whereabouts of Malcolm could
easily be guessed.</p>
<p>Carver, in white trousers and a crimson Gordon
sweater, was idly roaming about the ranch in search
of any diversion which might present itself, and
which did not require any too much exertion. For
two weeks and more things had not been going well
with him. His stay in Wyoming was not closing
so happily as it had begun&mdash;all due, he admitted to
himself, to a missed opportunity. For had he seized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
the chance when it was given him on the morning
after that disastrous night on the mountain, and
taken the laugh he had so richly deserved, by now
the incident, like Vivian&#8217;s affair with Mr. Crusoe,
would be forgotten. Instead, he had accepted ill-gotten
commendation, and received with it the well-disguised
scorn of Virginia. This last was the worst
of all.</p>
<p>He wandered down to the corral. If there were
a horse around he might change his clothes and
ride. Dave was there, repairing some harnesses.
There were no horses down, he said, except old
Ned. They were all on the range. Carver might
ride Ned, or take him to round up the others. For
a moment Carver thought of asking Dave to do the
service for him, but the determined set of the old
Scotchman&#8217;s jaw warned him in time. Dave was
averse to taking orders from a tenderfoot. It was
too much like work, Carver concluded, to round up
a decent horse, and to ride Ned would not alleviate
his present mood. He would walk.</p>
<p>Old Dave, intent on his harnesses, did not see
Carver jump the farther boundary of the corral.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
Had he done so, he would have shouted a warning
not to stray too far on foot across the range.
The cattle were being driven farther down toward
the ranch, and they were often averse to solitary
persons on foot.</p>
<p>Carver, all unperceived, climbed the foot-hills, his
hands deep in his pockets, his eyes on the ground.
It was all a bad mess, he thought, and how to get
out of it, he didn&#8217;t know. Of one thing he was
certain: the West was not the place for him. The
dreams in which he had lived only three weeks ago&mdash;dreams
of opening a branch of his father&#8217;s business
in the West when he should have finished college&mdash;had
vanished. He had now decided he was
born to remain a New Englander. There were
things about the West which he didn&#8217;t like&mdash;blunt,
unpolished, new things. Of course these ranchers
didn&#8217;t mind crudities. They could fraternize with
ordinary cow-punchers. Even Donald could do
that. But <i>he</i> had been reared differently. He struck
his toe against a rock, which he kicked savagely out
of his way. No, the Standishes were New Englanders,
and there they would remain!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>He reached the brow of the first foot-hills, crossed
an open space, and climbed others to the open range
above. When he again reached a level he stopped
in surprise. Never had he seen so many cattle.
There were literally hundreds of them. Where had
they all come from? He stood still and stared at
them, and they with one accord stopped browsing
and stared at him. They were unaccustomed to persons
strolling on foot across their preserves. For
an instant Carver Standish felt a strange sense of
fear. There was something portentous in the way
a big red and white bull in the foreground was staring
at him. Then he saw Donald on horseback off
to the right, and waved his hand. But Donald, spying
the white trousers and the red sweater in the
same instant, did not stop to wave. Instead, he
struck MacDuff with his spur, skirted the cattle
nearest him, and rode madly down toward Carver
and those ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;coming up here
in that rig and afoot. Old Rex will never stand it
for a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right. Old Rex had not the slightest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
inention of standing it. He ate no more, but with lowered
head gazed at this curiously clad intruder, who
was hesitating, not knowing whether to advance or
to turn back. Old Rex decided for him. He did
the advancing. One shake of his heavy head,
crowned with long, sharp horns, one cloud of dust
as he pawed the ground, and one tremendous bellow
warned Carver Standish III to do no tarrying in
that locality.</p>
<p>A shout from Donald following Old Rex&#8217;s roar
determined Carver&#8217;s direction. He fled toward
MacDuff at a speed which would have won any
twenty-five yard cup in New England! Old Rex
followed. The other cattle, curiously enough and
much to Donald&#8217;s relief, let their champion fight it
out alone.</p>
<p>Donald, every moment drawing nearer, freed his
left foot from the stirrup. Carver must somehow
be made to jump behind the saddle, and jump quick!
There was not an instant to lose. Old Rex was
gaining, and Carver was growing tired. It was too
hot up there for a red sweater. With the bull a
scant thirty feet away Donald pulled in MacDuff,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
and yelled to Carver to jump, which he did, aided
by the stirrup, Donald&#8217;s arm, and the last bit of
ancestral nerve he possessed. When Old Rex,
baffled and defeated, saw his foe being championed
by one whom he full well knew, it took but a yell
from Donald and a mighty crack of his quirt to
send him back among the herd.</p>
<p>There seemed little enough to say as MacDuff
bore his double load down over the hills to the lower
range, where white trousers and red sweaters might
be countenanced. But something had returned to
Carver, something which for two weeks had been
on a vacation. As they neared the home foot-hills,
he slid from MacDuff.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not in a hurry, Don,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let&#8217;s
rest here a minute. MacDuff is tired, I know, and
there are some things I want to get straightened
out before we go down home.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The next afternoon while Jack searched the ranch
for his scattered possessions and tried in vain to
stow them all away in his trunk, while three crestfallen
girls packed at the Hunter ranch, Carver,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
fresh from an interview with Mr. Keith, sat down
to write his father. The letter, received four days
later in place of its author by the Standish family,
brought surprise and consternation in its wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I simply can&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; said Mrs. Carver
Standish II, on the verge of hysterical tears. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never known him to do such a thing before. There&#8217;s
Ruth Sherman&#8217;s house-party coming off, and the
St. Clair wedding, and the tennis tournament,
and our trip to the Adirondacks&mdash;and everything!
Whatever shall I tell people who inquire? There&#8217;s
something wrong with him, Carver! I never did
want him to go to that place, anyway. You&#8217;d better
wire!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see but that it&#8217;s plain enough,&#8221; said his
father. &#8220;He simply prefers threshing on a Wyoming
ranch to a house-party or a wedding or a tennis
tournament or the Adirondacks. Let him alone.
Maybe a little work won&#8217;t hurt him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt him!&#8221; cried a certain gray-haired old gentleman,
slapping his knees. &#8220;Hurt him! It&#8217;ll be the
best thing that ever happened to him, in <i>my</i> opinion!
Work, and being with that little girl out there!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I did so want Mrs. Van Arsdale to see
him!&#8221; continued his mother. &#8220;I&#8217;d planned all sorts of
things for September. Read the letter again, Carver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Carver Standish II read the letter. It was
brief and to the point.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Dad</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m not coming home till school opens. I&#8217;m
going to stay out here and help thresh. Mr.
Keith is short on hands, and he says I&#8217;ll do. I
wanted to help for nothing, they&#8217;ve all been so
good to me&mdash;but he says I mustn&#8217;t. You needn&#8217;t
send me any money, because I&#8217;m going to be earning
two dollars a day, and maybe three if I&#8217;m any
good. Please don&#8217;t let Mother object. It won&#8217;t
do any good anyhow, because I&#8217;ve already signed
a contract to stay. Mr. Keith didn&#8217;t want to draw
it up, but I insisted. He does it with the other
men, and I&#8217;m no better than the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve got a great scheme about bringing the
business West when I&#8217;m through college. It sure
is some country out here! Love to Grandfather.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Carver</span>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>That Carver Standish III preferred threshing on
a Wyoming ranch to a house-party was the subject
of conversation at every social affair for a
week and more. Poor Mrs. Carver Standish II
found explanations most difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carver&#8217;s so in love with the country and riding
and all that he just won&#8217;t come back,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But Carver&#8217;s grandfather, the old Colonel, found
no such difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;My grandson,&#8221; he said, his fine head thrown
back, and his blue eyes glowing with pride, &#8220;my
grandson is discovering the dignity of labor on a
Wyoming ranch!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>COMRADES</h3>
</div>

<p>Wyoming, to be appreciated, should be explored
on horseback and not viewed from the observation
platform of a limited train. Barren stretches of
sagebrush and cactus, and grim, ugly buttes guard
too well the secret that golden wheat-fields lie beyond
them; the rugged, far-away mountains never
tell that their canyon-cut sides are clothed with timber
and carpeted with a thousand flowers; and tired,
dusty travelers, quite unaware of these things, find
themselves actually longing for Nebraska to break
the monotony!</p>
<p>The half-dozen weary persons who on the afternoon
of September 6th sat on the observation platform
of the Puget Sound Limited, together with the
scores who peered from its windows in vain search
of something besides sagebrush, were no exception
to the rule. To a man, they were all giving fervent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
thanks that Fate had cast their lots in California
or New England or, at the worst, Iowa. The assurances
of the brakeman, who was loquacious beyond
his kind, that once past Elk Creek they would strike
a better country brought some much-needed cheerfulness;
and Elk Creek itself afforded such amusement
and entertainment that they really began to
have a better impression of Wyoming. Apparently,
there were civilized persons even in so desolate an
environment as this!</p>
<p>The sources of their entertainment, for they were
several, stood on the little station platform at Elk
Creek. The central figure was a tall, middle-aged
man, whose hands were filled with trunk checks
and tickets, and to whom three very excited girls
were saying good-by all at the same time. Three
boys, two in khaki and one in traveling clothes,
were shaking hands heartily; a fresh-faced young
woman with marigolds at her waist stood a little
apart from the others and talked earnestly with a
tall young man; and a hatless, brown-haired girl
in a riding suit seemed to be everywhere at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t bear to think it&#8217;s all over!&#8221; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
interested travelers heard her say, as she embraced the
three girls in turn. &#8220;It&#8217;s been absolutely the most
perfect six weeks I&#8217;ve ever, ever known. Don&#8217;t lose
your quirt, Vivian! And don&#8217;t leave Allan&#8217;s knife
around, Mary. It isn&#8217;t fair to tempt even a porter.
You&#8217;ll write from every large place, won&#8217;t you,
Priscilla?&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of an amused and impatient conductor,
the last-named girl turned back for a last hug. Her
hat was askew, her brown hair disheveled, and her
brown eyes full of tears, which were coursing freely
down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Virginia,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you&#8217;re the biggest
peach I ever knew! Remember, you&#8217;re going to
think of me every night at seven o&#8217;clock. It&#8217;ll be
nine for me in Boston, but I&#8217;ll not forget. And it&#8217;s
only three weeks before I see you again. That&#8217;s
a comfort!&#8221;</p>
<p>She hurried toward the waiting train, at the
steps of which a boy in khaki stood ready to help
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Carver,&#8221; she cried, shaking hands for
at least the fourth time. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to see your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
grandfather the very first thing and tell him what
a good sport you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>A mad rush for the observation platform ensued&mdash;the
three girls, the boy, and the young woman
reaching it just in time to wave good-by to those
left behind. The brown-eyed girl swept the faces
of her fellow travelers at one glance, nodded to the
interested brakeman with a surprised and pleased
smile, and then, just as the train began to move,
hurried to the railing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Virginia!&#8221; she cried to the girl in the riding-suit.
&#8220;What do you think! I&#8217;ve got the very same
brakeman! Doesn&#8217;t that make the ending just
perfect?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Two hours later a boy and a girl on horseback
forded Elk Creek, rode up the Valley, and to the
summit of the highest foot-hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we rode up here,&#8221; said Virginia. &#8220;I&#8217;m
missing them already, and to be up here with you
helps a lot! Do you remember a year ago, Don?
&#8217;Twas in this very spot that we planned and planned,
and the day was just like this, too&mdash;all clear and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
golden. It just seems as though every year is lovelier
than the last, and this one has been the very loveliest
of all my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; said Donald thoughtfully, leaning forward
in his saddle to pat MacDuff, &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s been
the best of my life, too, counting this summer and
all. Last year at school was great, with college
always ahead&mdash;sort of a dream almost true, you
know. And then to have Jack and Carver here,
and all the girls with you, finished everything up
just right. But the best part of the year to me,
Virginia,&#8221; he finished hesitatingly, &#8220;was June when
you came back, and I found you weren&#8217;t a young
lady after all. I was some glad, I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s gray eyes looked at the mountains,
swept the golden prairie stretches, and lingered for
a long moment on the cottonwoods which bordered
Elk Creek before they came back to Donald&#8217;s blue
ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, too,&#8221; she said simply.</p>
<p>Pedro and MacDuff sniffed the September air and
gloried in it. They were impatient for a wild run
across the brow of the hills, and wondered why their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
riders chose to look so long at the mountains on
such an afternoon as this. If they sat so silently
much longer, there would be no time to make the
mesa, to gallop across its wide surface, and at last,
perhaps, to have supper among the sagebrush with
Robert Bruce. They felt somewhat encouraged
when Virginia began to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to decide the very loveliest
thing of all the year,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I mean from
September to June. I don&#8217;t know whether &#8217;twas
the Vigilantes or Miss Wallace or Grandmother
Webster, but I&#8217;m almost sure &#8217;twas Grandmother
Webster learning to love Father. The others were
joys for me, but that was one for all of us. Of
course we know the loveliest thing of this summer.
Everything&#8217;s been perfect, but Aunt Nan and Malcolm
the most perfect of all. Yesterday, when
Grandmother Webster&#8217;s letter came, I just cried for
joy, it was so lovely!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t help comparing it with the one she
wrote Mother about Father,&#8221; she continued, a little
break in her voice. &#8220;I found it&mdash;afterward&mdash;in
Mother&#8217;s things. She didn&#8217;t understand at all then.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
I guess it takes some people a long time to understand
things. But I&#8217;m going to try to forget that
because Grandmother Webster knows now just how
splendid Father is. Besides,&#8221; she finished thoughtfully,
&#8220;it&#8217;s going to be very hard for Grandmother
to give Aunt Nan up. I guess we can&#8217;t even imagine
how hard it&#8217;s going to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we can&#8217;t I think it&#8217;s fine of her to
take it the way she does. What relation will that
make you and me?&#8221; he finished practically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Priscilla and I figured it all out. You&#8217;re no relation
at all&mdash;just my uncle&#8217;s brother. Makes you
sound about forty-five, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound exactly young. When do you
suppose it will happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Nan doesn&#8217;t know. Malcolm says Christmas,
but she says no, she must have a year with
Grandmother. So I think it will be in June&mdash;just
after school is out. Webster is lovely then&mdash;all
filled with daisies and buttercups and wild roses.
And you&#8217;ll come on, Don&mdash;of course you will. And
Priscilla will be there, and Mary and Vivian and
Carver and Jack and maybe Dorothy! I want you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
to see Dorothy. Oh, won&#8217;t it be the happiest time?
I&#8217;m getting excited already!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The horses want to go,&#8221; said Donald. &#8220;I&#8217;ll race
you to the edge of the mesa. Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Five minutes later they looked at each other, red-cheeked
and radiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;In together, just as usual,&#8221; cried Donald.
&#8220;There&#8217;s never much difference!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My hair makes me think of Priscilla,&#8221; said Virginia,
brushing back some loose locks and re-tying
her ribbon. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t she funny this afternoon when
she said good-by, her hat on one side and her hair
all falling down, and her eyes full of tears? I can&#8217;t
help saying all over and over how lovely it&#8217;s been.
And now another year&#8217;s beginning, and in two
weeks more you and I will go away to school again.
I&#8217;m wondering,&#8221; she finished thoughtfully, &#8220;I&#8217;m
wondering if next June, when we ride up here, you&#8217;ll
say that I&#8217;m not a young lady after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t feel you&#8217;re going to be&mdash;too grown-up,
do you?&#8221; There was anxiety in Donald&#8217;s
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not in the way you mean,&#8221; Virginia
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
promised him. &#8220;Not ever like Imogene or Katrina Van
Rensaelar. But I <i>am</i> growing up! I feel it coming!
It&#8217;s just as though I&#8217;d met my older self and
shaken hands with her before she went away again,
for, you see, she hasn&#8217;t come to stay for keeps yet.
I think she came the first time when Jim went away,
and then again at Easter time when Miss King
talked to us at Vespers, and then this summer when
Aunt Nan told me about Malcolm. That time she
stayed longest of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope she won&#8217;t be a lot different from you,&#8221;
said Donald. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t want to have to get acquainted
all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t,&#8221; Virginia assured him. &#8220;Only she
knows a lot more than I know, and she&#8217;s told me a
great many things already. That night on the
mountain she came and stayed with me while Vivian
and Carver were asleep. I learned so many things
that night, Don. I&#8217;m just sure she taught them to
me&mdash;she and the night and the stillness.&#8221; Her voice
softened. &#8220;Somehow, away up there on the mountain,
life seemed such a big, wonderful thing&mdash;all
full of dreams and opportunities and surprises
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
and&mdash;and comrades, all going along the same trail.
Don&#8217;t you like to think of life as a trail&mdash;like
the kind that leads to Lone Mountain, I mean&mdash;all
full of dangers and surprises and beautiful
things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said simply. His eyes as he watched
her filled with pride in their comradeship&mdash;his and
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, oh, that makes me think!&#8221; she cried excitedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten to tell you about the poem
Miss Wallace sent me yesterday. You see, I&#8217;m collecting
lovely ones, and she&#8217;s such a help in sending
them to me. I learned this one to say to you. Of
course she didn&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s just like we were
the Christmas before I went away to school when
you were home for the holidays. Don&#8217;t you remember
how we went for Christmas greens up Bear
Canyon in that big snow-storm and didn&#8217;t get home
until long after dark, and how Jim and William
were just starting to hunt for us? Listen! I know
you&#8217;ll like it. It&#8217;s called &#8216;Comrades.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like it, Don?&#8221; she finished eagerly. &#8220;I
do. I like it because I think it shows the finest kind
of friendship&mdash;the kind that makes you free to do
just what seems right and best to <i>you</i>, and yet makes
you glad of your friends. Miss Wallace calls it
the friendship which doesn&#8217;t <i>demand</i>, and it&#8217;s her
ideal, too. I&#8217;m sure she was thinking of that when
she sent me the poem. And then I like it most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
of all because it makes me think of that Christmas,
and the good time we had. Don&#8217;t you like it?&#8221;
she repeated.</p>
<p>In her eagerness she was all unconscious that she
had given him no time to reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I should say I do like it. I
guess I&#8217;ll copy it, if you don&#8217;t mind. And, Virginia,&#8221;
he added, hesitating, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know what
our comradeship means to me. You see, when a
fellow goes away to college the way I&#8217;m going, it
helps him to be&mdash;to be on the square in everything,
if he has a comrade like&mdash;like you&#8217;ve always been.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no hesitation&mdash;only gladness in
Virginia&#8217;s frank gray eyes as she looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; she cried, her face flooded
with happiness. &#8220;That&#8217;s the very kind of a comrade
I want to be, Don! I like to feel just as it says
in the poem:</p>
